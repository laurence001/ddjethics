Albania;Code of ethics for journalists;2018;"Introduction
The Code of Ethics is a self-regulating instrument which aims to guide, strengthen and improve the quality of journalism and the sense of responsibility of journalists in Albania.

The principles of this Code are in line with the universal ethical values of journalism, which are widely recognized and accepted by media organizations and journalism unions in democratic countries. They are a cornerstone of democratic pluralism and also respect the spirit of the Constitution of the Republic of Albania, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights.
The Role of Media in Society
Freedom of speech, freedom of information and criticism, freedom of the press, and access to official documents are basic elements of a democratic society.

Media play an extraordinarily important role in society, by providing reliable and timely news and information in various forms and through assorted platforms. The media serve as watchdogs, holding centers of power to account and constantly monitoring government authorities and organizations, institutions and businesses. Media play a fundamental role in the democratic processes and provide ample opportunities and a safe environment to allow journalists to perform their duties independently.

The media recognize the importance of pluralism in society and respect the diversity of opinions, opposing all discrimination based on sex, race, nationality, language, religion, ideology, culture, class, conviction, or any other cause.

The media recognize and defend both its rights and duties versus the public, constantly preserving the balance between them.
The Scope of the Code
The following regulations concerning conduct shall apply to all persons and organizations engaging in the gathering, editing, preparation and dissemination of journalistic information. The scope of the Code shall cover the individual and collective supply of information performed in the field of printed (text and photography) and electronic media.

The Code refers to individual and collective responsibilities in the supply of information performed in the field of printed (text and photography) and electronic media.

The principles of this Code apply equally to all media and journalistic platforms, offline and online, including journalism disseminated through social media and internet portals.

The Code of Ethics presumes and expects that all media organizations and journalists recognize and accept the voluntary principles set out in this Code. All those who engage in journalism are invited to acknowledge and accept the following principles as necessary to the well-being of journalism and freedom of expression in Albania.

Journalists who knowingly violate the principles of this code betray the trust of the public and may not expect the support and solidarity of their colleagues, media organizations or journalism trade unions. Controversies arising from alleged violations of the Code are dealt with through transparent systems of voluntary self-regulation developed by journalists and news media organizations that may operate at the level of the enterprise and across different platforms of the news media industry.
1. Accuracy and Fairness of Information
Journalists have the right to seek information and the right of access to public information. They have the right to publish and to criticize.

Journalists and news media shall at all times strive to publish information that is to the best of their knowledge truthful, balanced and verified.

Accuracy

A journalist must verify information prior to its publication in order to ensure that it is accurate, fact-based and trustworthy. All data and information must be subject to careful scrutiny: whether it is obtained from human sources or documents.

Journalists should always indicate where information has not been confirmed.

Media should not mislead the public. They should clearly indicate where manipulated texts, documents, images and sounds have been used.

Media shall not publish any photos, image, audio, or visual arrangements that distort the ideas or facts of the source, with the exception of caricatures, cartoons or comic plots.

Unbiased Journalism

Journalists shall strive to provide unbiased and balanced reporting. Journalists shall refer to all available sources and interested parties that can provide useful and relevant information. In reporting on a controversy, journalists should be inclusive and seek to ensure that all parties concerned have an opportunity to state their position. Criticized parties shall have the right to respond to accusations, whenever possible in the same publication. Journalists shall make every effort to contact all sides and gather all relevant opinions. Mere contacts with both sides do not release' a journalist from the obligation to present both sides of a story, and to report as truthfully as possible. The principle of presenting all sides' may not apply in publications representing personal opinions (editorials, opinion pieces) as well as reports of a factual nature, such as reporting on public meetings or events.
2. Distinguishing Fact from Opinion
Media must distinguish clearly between opinion and comments and fact-based reporting. Columnist, caricaturists, and critics are allowed to present their opinions on individuals and events. News relates to information supported by facts and data, while an opinion piece contains and represents ideas, opinions and considerations of journalists, editors and publishers.
3. Rectification and Reply
Media shall be open to engage with their audience and to deal with legitimate comments and complaints.

Media should publish a clear and appropriately prominent correction when it can be demonstrated that inaccurate or misleading information has been published. Media should provide an apology and appropriate remedy where it is necessary.

A criticized party shall always have the right of response.

If the reply is not fit for publication as such, changes to it should be discussed with the writer. If he or she cannot be contacted within a reasonable time, the reply may be published in amended form. However, its essential contents must not be changed.
4. Relations with Sources
Journalists shall strive to gather information from all available sources in order to provide accurate, complete, and impartial information.

Journalists shall be transparent in their work and use methods for gathering information that are ethical and lawful.

A person being interviewed has the right to know in which medium and in what connection statements will be used.

Journalists shall exercise care in the selection of sources and establish clear working relations with them to make sure that the information they receive is correct.

Media shall exercise particular care in dealing with sources who are members of vulnerable groups, such as children and young people, victims of violence or minorities.

Media shall not distort or misuse statements made in a specific context. In particular consideration should be shown towards people who cannot be expected to be aware of the effect that their statements may have.

Journalists shall not divulge the name of a person when information is provided on a confidential basis, unless consent has been explicitly given by the person concerned.

The right to the anonymity may be broken only if:

a) There is suspicion that the source consciously has distorted truth or is seeking to manipulate media for personal gain;

b) The reference to the name of the source is the only way to avoid serious and inevitable damage to others;

c) The information in question relates to the planning of a serious criminal act or is of major concern for public welfare.

If unjustly denied access to requested information, a journalist has the right to inform the general public about it.
5. Editorial independence
Media shall avoid unacceptable conflicts of interest and shall not permit any undue influence arising from personal beliefs, political or financial incentives to affect the accurate and impartial reporting of their journalists and work of editorial departments.

Journalists, publishers, and media owners must resist threats, provocations, or incentives to influence, distort or conceal information. They shall not use any information or data collected during their job for their own personal benefit.

Editorial content should be clearly distinguished from marketing, advertisements, materials prepared by political parties or other institutions/organizations, or sponsored content. Sponsored content must clearly show the identity of the sponsor.

Commercial and political advertising, as well as sponsored content  including articles and supplements  shall be labeled accordingly to ensure the media audience can distinguish them from editorial content.
6. Pre-publication Agreement
Journalists who agree not to publish a piece of information or material for a given period of time must respect these arrangements. Such an agreement (embargo) should be considered null and void if the information is published by another party, or when the person who requested the embargo in any way violates terms and conditions of the agreement reached between parties.

In the interests of fairness and accuracy journalists may show their news stories to interested parties prior to publication, but they shall not grant a veto on the right to publish and shall be free to decide for themselves on what suggestions they should take under consideration.
7. Liability after Publication
The publisher and editor are liable and responsible for the publication of news articles as well as letters to the editor, comments and replies published on the media website including where the name of the author is omitted or signed under an alias.

Media and editorial staff should agree to and publish clearly defined terms and conditions for the selection and publishing of comments from the public. Media shall monitor and review such comments and take steps to ensure the terms and conditions of publication are respected.

Media have the right to add a note' on comments and replies, or even decide not to publish them at all, with the exception of cases when it has previously promised to publish such comments. The editorial staff reserves the right to edit or shorten letters to the editor, or comments, provided that the editing does not alter their meaning. If the media organization were to decide to publish a letter to the editor or comment, it should do so within a reasonable amount of time between the moment it was submitted and the time of publishing.

Prior to publishing a comment, or a letter to the editor, where there is a suggestion that it contains serious accusations against a third party, the editorial staff, or the editor, shall investigate if there is any basis to these accusations. Also, the accused party must be afforded the opportunity to respond.

It may not realistically be expected that all comments be read, edited, or rejected prior to publication. However, the editorial staff, or the editors, may delete or remove unacceptable comments from publication where it is abusive, hateful, or is found to contain malicious and unfounded allegations. Where there is a complaint that a comment includes serious accusations or insults directed at a third party, the editorial staff and the editors shall investigate whether there is any basis to such accusations, and, if so, the comment must be removed from publication.

9. Intrusion into private life
Media and journalists shall respect the honor and reputation of individuals who become objects of their professional interest.

Any incorrect or false information that intentionally or unintentionally may cause harm to the image and reputation of another person constitutes a breach of human dignity.

Only the protection of the public interest can justify journalistic investigations which interfere with the private aspects of the lives of individuals. Journalists shall only make reference to personal or private aspects of people's lives when they are relevant.

Journalists will use fair methods in the collection of information. They only make use of subterfuge, hidden cameras, microphones or other special equipment, or obscure their professional identity, in circumstances where:

a) There is no other means to obtain the information concerned

b) The information is of urgent and serious concern to the public

Journalists shall indicate when such methods have been used in the story or provide disclosure when circumstances permit.

'Sudden' use of cameras in public or institutions should respect the desire and sensitivity of the present persons.

Public figures are entitled to less privacy than other individuals. However, information on their private lives and information related to their family and friends should be disclosed only when it serves the public interest. Public officers are also justified in not disclosing their private life except for the cases when their private life may affect their public activity.
10. Conflict of Interest
Journalists, editors and editorial managers must not seek personal gain from information and evidence collected by their media organization. Media organizations shall ensure that there are internal arrangements for the declaration of potential conflicts of interest at all levels of ownership, management and editorial activity.

11. Incitement to Crime and Violence
The propagation of war, violence, outrage or malicious information intended to injure the feelings of the whole public or parts of it is unethical and unacceptable in any media product. Violence and brutality shall not be sensationalized.

 	<li>The finding, prevention, and disclosure of serious crimes, scandals, and abuse of power;</li>
 	<li>Actions to protect the public from the danger of being seriously misled.</li>

Journalists should respect and carefully observe the rules of the Albanian language. The use of foreign words should be avoided except for clarity of meaning or when appropriate in direct reporting."
Austria;Guiding principles for journalistic activities;2019;"Preamble
Journalism requires freedom and responsibility. Newspaper publishers and editors, broadcasting and television managers, as well as journalists have particular responsibility for maintaining the freedom of the mass media, which is a vitally important element of democratic life.

This is a special challenge for the heads of editorial offices, who have to ensure the consistent respect of the principles that should guide the work of journalists under their authority.

The Austrian Press Council (Österreichischer Presserat) is the platform for all those who support the idea that the use of the freedom of the press should be guided by the principles of truthfulness and accuracy, and who are willing to submit their products, in concrete cases, to the scrutiny of the Press Council. Voluntary self-regulation on a permanent basis is an appropriate means to ensure that the press meets its responsibility.

For these reasons, the Austrian Press Council has laid down the following catalogue of principles (Code of Ethics for the Austrian Press) for all those who are engaged on behalf of newspaper in the gathering, dissemination and commenting of the news. This catalogue can be supplemented or interpreted by guidelines as and when needed. The principles stated below shall hold for all those parts of a publication, which are under the editors' responsibility.

Newspaper and magazines that commit themselves to compliance with the principles of this Code of Ethics undertake to publish every and any finding of the Austrian Press Council directed against said newspaper or magazine and the publication of which the Council has required (signet in their imprint).
1. Freedom

 	The Freedom of news reporting and commenting, be it in words or in pictures, forms an integral part of the freedom of press. There shall be no restrictions regarding the collection and dissemination of news and comment.
 	For the Press Council and its activities, the limits to this freedom are set by the journalists' voluntary self-regulation based on the provision of this Code of Ethics.

2. Accuracy

 	It is the prime duty of journalists to aim at a maximum of conscientiousness and accuracy in their investigations, the presentation of news items, and comments in them.
 	Quotes between quotation marks shall reflect the tenor as detailed as possible, and no quotation marks shall be used for passages, which merely render the generic sense of a statement. Quoting from anonymous sources should be avoided unless anonymity is required in the interest of the safety of the person quoted or in order to protect such person from some other serious disadvantage.
 	No charges shall be made against any person(s) or institution(s) unless proof can be furnished that an attempt has been made to obtain a statement on said charges form the person(s) or institution(s) so charged. If the charge in question has been made in public, this circumstance shall be clearly indicated, and the source of said charge shall be named.
 	As soon as an editorial office is advised of the fact that it has published a wrong statement, professional ethics and common decency demand that a correction of a said statement be published voluntarily.
 	Any justified statement on the part of a reader or readers calling for correction of a report shall be published as soon as possible and as extensive as required.
 	Adequate coverage shall be given to any important court decision or finding of another public authority regarding a subject on which the newspaper or magazine has reported or to any essential new findings concerning said subject that have emerged in some other way.

3. Distinctive Character of Reports

 	Readers shall be left in no doubts as to whether a newspaper item is a factual report, the reproduction of the views of a third party or third parties, or comment.
 	In case of serious doubts about the correctness of a quotation, the validity of third-party statements shall be checked before said statements are reproduced.
 	Photomontages and picture material that has been modified shall be clearly marked as such if a cursory reading might otherwise lead the reader to believe them to be documentary in nature.

4. Influence

 	Form and content of contributions to the editorial sections of a newspaper or magazine shall on no account be influenced by outside interests.
 	Such improper influence shall be deemed to comprise not only interventions or pressure that is brought to bear on a journalist but also the granting of personal advantages relative to matters that lie outside the immediate realm of the journalist's professional work.
 	Any person who accepts, in the context of his/her work as a journalist, presents or any other personal advantages likely to influence the journalistic product shall be deemed to have breached this Code of Ethics.
 	The publishers' economic interests shall not affect editorial content in any way that might result in wrong information or the suppression of important information.
 	If a journalist publishes a report on a journey, which has been paid for by a third party, this fact shall be mentioned in the report in a suitable way.

5. Protection of Personality

 	Every person is entitled to the protection and respect of his/her dignity and personality.
 	Libellous or disparaging statements about a person or persons violate the Code of Ethics.
 	Persons whose life is in jeopardy shall not be identified in media reports if such identification is likely to expose them to even greater danger.
 	Particular attention must be paid to the anonymity interests of victims of accidents or crimes. The identity of a victim may be disclosed if there is an official reason to do so, if the victim is a well-known person, or if the victim or close relatives have consented to the disclosure.

6. Privacy

 	The privacy of all individuals shall in principle be protected.
 	In the case of children, protection of the individual's privacy shall take precedence over the news value.
 	Before pictures and reports about juveniles are published, special critical consideration shall be given to the question of whether such publication is in the public interest.
 	Reports about criminal offences or misconduct on the part of juveniles shall not render more difficult or completely prevent their eventual re-integration into society. In such cases, the individual's full name shall not be published.
 	Journalists shall exercise particular caution in interviewing and photographing children and in reporting about matters which might have a detrimental influence on their future.

7. Protection from Sweeping Statements and Discrimination

 	Sweeping statements which disparage or incite suspicion against a person or group of persons shall be strictly avoided.
 	Any discrimination for reasons of age, disability, sex, race, religion, nationality, sexuality, ideology or for any other reason shall be inadmissible.
 	Any disparagement or derision of religious teachings or recognized churches and religious communities liable to give justified offence shall be inadmissible.

8. Procurement of Material

 	No unfair or improper methods shall be used in obtaining oral or procuring written evidence.
 	Unfair or improper methods shall include misrepresentation, pressure, intimidation, exploitation of emotional or stressful situations and, as a rule, the use of wiretapping or bugging equipment.
 	In some cases undercover investigations and the associated actions deemed necessary are permitted, provided that the method of the recherché is appropriate and the gathered information is in the public interest.
 	The use of private photographs for publication shall be conditional upon the previous consent of the person(s) affected or, in the case of minors, their parents or guardians, unless publication of the picture is justified as being in the public interest.

9. Special Editorial Areas

 	Travelogues and reports of a touristic nature shall include, in suitable form, information about the social and political background and conditions prevailing in the country or region in question (such as serious human rights violations).
 	Environmental, transport and energy policy matters shall, amongst other things, be given adequate consideration in the paper's motor section.
 	Reports about tourist areas, catering establishments and motor cars as well as all evaluative reports on consumer goods and services shall meet generally accepted criteria and be written by persons with professional journalistic qualifications.

10. Public Interest

 	In concrete cases, and in particular in the case of public figures, it may be necessary to weigh carefully the justified interest of that individual in not having a report or a photograph published against the public interest in having said material published.
 	The term 'public interest' within the meaning of this Code of Ethics for the Austrian Press shall in particular refer to situations in which publications of the facts in question might help to bring a criminal to justice, or might be desirable in the interest of protecting public security or health or preventing the general public from being misled.
 	The publication of photographs of (a) person(s) which have been taken without respect to their privacy (e.g. in case of waylaying) is only permitted if a great public interest is clearly perceptible and not only voyeurism is prevailing.

11. Interests of Media Employees
The press is just able to fulfil the special responsibility towards the public, if private as well as commercial interests of media employees have no bearing on the editorial content. Media employees use information, which is not publicly accessible and which they ascertain in the course of their professional career. This information shall just be used for journalistic purposes and not for personal advantage or the advantage of a third party.
12. Suicide Coverage
Media coverage on suicides and self-inflicted injury as well as on suicide attempts and attempts of self-inflicted injury has to be treated with much reserve. Especially because of the danger of imitation, responsible-minded journalists weigh up if the information is in the public interest and abstain from exaggerated reporting."
Belgium (Flanders);Code of practice;2023;""
Belgium (French-speaking);CDJ's code of journalistic ethics;2015;"Adopted by the Council of Journalistic Ethics (CDJ) on 16th October 2013
Preamble
The right to information, freedom of expression and criticism are fundamental rights and essential prerequisites for a democratic society.

Journalists have the right and duty to inform the public about matters of public interest. This should not to be confused with the curiosity of the public, which does not have an absolute right to know everything. Journalists do not have an absolute right to disclose everything.

The public's right to know these matters determines both journalistic freedom and responsibility. Journalists are bound by standards that derive from the obligations of:

 	disseminating verified information;
 	collecting and disseminating information independently;
 	acting with loyalty;
 	respecting the rights of persons.

Any other person who disseminates information is encouraged to adhere to these standards.

Journalists' responsibility towards the public takes precedence over their responsibilities to special interests, public authorities and their employers.

Journalists have a social responsibility inherent in press freedom.

Disclaimer Some of the standards contained in this Code are supplemented, clarified or developed by guidelines presented in Part III of the document and available on the CDJ website. They are indicated by an arrow (=&gt;).

Journalists may exceptionally bypass certain rules of this Code when the information is of overriding public interest and cannot be collected or reported in any other way. The rules to which exceptions may be made subject to any additional conditions are marked with an *.

Amendments to the Code after 2013 appear in italics with the date of approval by the CDJ in square brackets.

III. Act with Loyalty
Art. 17 Journalists shall use fair methods to collect and process information, photos, images and documents. =&gt;

 	the methods used are authorised or, where appropriate, validated by the editor-in-chief, except in the case of unforeseeable exceptions.

Art. 24 Journalists shall take into account the rights of any person mentioned explicitly or implicitly in a piece of information. They shall weigh these rights against the general interest of the information. Image rights apply to images accessible online.

Art. 25 Journalists shall respect the privacy of individuals and shall not reveal any personal data that are not relevant to the general interest. =&gt;

Art. 26 Journalists shall avoid intrusion into the pain of persons and the dissemination of information and images offensive to human dignity except where relevant to the public interest.

Part II Definitions
Image rights Every natural person has a right to his or her image and to the use made of it, a right which no one may, in principle, enjoy without his or her prior consent. However, in the field of information, when a person is identifiable in an image, his consent may be presumed, in particular when his image has been captured in a public place or at a public event without unjustified emphasis, as well as when the person represented makes his image public himself or when he has given his tacit but certain consent to the taking of photographs.

General interest From the point of view of journalistic ethics, information that raises one or more issues for society as a whole or for one of its components is of general interest. Some codes use the terms public interest or societal interest. These terms all mark the difference with special interest. In any case, general interest is not to be confused with mere curiosity on the part of the public.

Journalist For the purposes of this Code, a journalist is any person who contributes directly to the collection, editorial processing, production and/or dissemination of information, through a media outlet, intended for the public and in the interest of the public.

Media A natural or legal person whose activity is the production and/or dissemination of journalistic information, regardless of the medium used.

Plagiarism By plagiarism, this code refers to the textual or quasi-textual reproduction of an original work without quoting the author.

Editorial The term editorial staff refers to those responsible and all members of the group or department responsible for the collection and processing of journalistic content within a media outlet.

[^1]: On 16th December 2015, The Council  CDJ  decided to remove provocation, blackmail and harassment from the list in Article 17. These practices remain criminal offences considered as unfair methods, but they are difficult to objectivise, unlike the methods which remain explicitly designated as unfair above. [^2]: On 25th May 2016, prior to the adoption of the recommendation on information relating to foreigners or persons of foreign origin and assimilated themes, the CDJ decided to add the words ""... to racism and xenophobia"" at the end of article 28 of the Code of Journalistic Ethics implementing it."

 	We shall not use our access to information as a means of obtaining personal gain, especially in respect to information regarding business performance and financial markets.

5. PUBLIC INTEREST

 	Infringement of the terms of this Code may only be justified where it can be clearly and fully demonstrated that the respective publication serves the best interests of the public.

Croatia;Croatian journalists' code of honour;2009;"GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The right to accurate, complete and timely information and freedom of thought and expression are one of the fundamental rights and freedoms of every human being, regardless of race, color, gender, language, religion, political or other belief, national or social background, posessions, birth, education, social status or other characteristics. This right of the public to be informed of the facts and opinions also implies the entirety of the obligations and rights of journalists. In their work, journalists have a duty to defend human rights, dignity, freedoms and values, respect the pluralism of ideas and views, resist all forms of censorship, contribute to strengthening the rule of law and participate, as part of the public, in democratic control of power and government. Journalists adhere to the Constitution and laws of the Republic of Croatia, nurture the culture and ethics of public expression and respect civilizational achievements and values. It is their obligation to adhere to professional ethical principles. This Code establishes these principles and protects the inalienable rights of individuals and the right of the public to information.
JOURNALISM AS A CALLING

 	In their activities, journalists are guided by the ethics of journalism as a calling. They safeguard the reputation, dignity and integrity of their profession, cooperate with each other and foster collegial relationships and professional solidarity.
 	Starting from the principle that in a democratic society the public media are free, independent, investigative and open to different and diverse opinions, the journalist bears responsibility for his/her work before the public, the law and his/her professional organization. By presenting his/her own and critical viewpoint in the search for truth, as a basic principle in professional work, the journalist actively participates in the creation of public opinion and collective reflection on topics of public interest.
 	A journalist has the right and the duty to refuse a work assignment that is contrary to the professional ethical standards of the journalistic work.
 	The work of journalists is subject to public criticism. Journalists and editorial staff are obliged to treat carefully and critically all comments and recommendations made to them.

INFORMATION FLOW
<ol start=""5"">
 	It is the right and duty of journalists to advocate the free information flow. The journalist is obliged to present accurate, complete and verified information. He/she critically judges the sources of information and, as per rule, cites them. He/she has the right not to disclose the source of the information, but is responsible for the published information.
 	In all journalistic contributions, including comments and polemics, the journalist is obliged to respect the ethics of public speech and the culture of dialogue and to respect the honor, reputation and dignity of the persons or groups with whom he or she enters into a discussion. When reporting on topics on which various relevant positions are present, and in particular when allegations are made, the journalist seeks to make all those views available to the public.
 	A journalist has the right to investigate freely all facts of public interest as well as the right of access to all related sources of information. If he/she is unjustifiably denied the requested information which is of public interest, he/she shall have the right to inform the public of such events. Paying to obtain information and cooperating with a source expecting payment, or any other favours in exchange for information, is only permissible if it is the only way of obtaining information of exceptional public interest.
 	A journalist must not abuse the trust established with the source of information. The legal person or natural person providing the information to the journalist must be informed by the journalist in what medium and in what context will this information be published. The meaning of statements and interviews should not be distorted by the journalist, either directly or by taking them out of context. Authorization only means the authentication of the content of the interview. Interview equipment is not subject to authorization. Once authorized, the interview is considered final.
 	When collecting information, a journalist may not use methods contrary to this Code unless there is no other way to obtain information of extreme public interest. Attempts to extort information through intimidation, threats, blackmail and other forms of coercion are unacceptable.
 	The journalist respects the legal provisions on confidentiality of information and the embargo on the publication of information. Breach of these restrictions is permissible only if they have been misused to prevent the publication of information of extreme public interest.
 	The journalist respects the authorship of other journalists and other participants in the public informing systems. In its appendices it lists the sources he/she used. Plagiarism is incompatible with journalistic ethics.
 	If the journalist has published inaccurate information, he/she is obliged to correct it as soon as possible. The correction should be published in the same or equivalent location of the media space and in the same or equivalent manner as the information to which the correction relates. The same applies to any other proceedings that violate the principles of this Code.

FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS
<ol start=""13"">
 	In their activities, journalists respect, protect and promote fundamental human rights and freedoms, and in particular the principle of equality for all citizens. Special responsibility is expected when reporting or commenting on the rights, needs, problems and demands of minority social groups. Information about race, colour, religion or nationality, ae, gender, sexual orientation, gender expression, any physical or mental personality or illness, marital status, lifestyle, social status, property status or educational level, is provided by a journalist only if is highly relevant in the context in which it is presented. It is inadmissible to use stereotypes, pejorative expressions, degrading portrayal, as well as any other form of direct or indirect incitement or support for discrimination.
 	A journalist should protect a person's intimacy from sensationalistic disclosure and any other unjustified disclosure to the public. He/she is bound to respect everyone's right to privacy. It is unacceptable to shoot or photograph people without their permission, in an environment where privacy is reasonably expected. Violation of one's privacy beyond one's will and knowledge is permissible only if justified by an exceptional public interest.
 	Particular attention, caution and accountability are required when reporting suicides, accidents, personal tragedies, illnesses, deaths and acts of violence. A journalist should avoid interviewing and portraying persons who are directly or indirectly affected by these events, except in the case of extreme public interest. In this case, the journalist is obliged to take into account the honor, reputation and dignity of the persons he/she reports about.
 	News of suicides and suicide attempts is not to be emphasized and should be kept to a minimum, with particular regard to children. The professional guidelines for suicide reporting need to be adhered to.
 	The reports and articles on court proceedings should respect the constitutional principle of the presumption of innocence of the accused and the dignity, integrity and feelings of all parties in the dispute. In criminal proceedings, journalists are obliged to respect the right to the protection of the identity of protected witnesses, confidants, whistleblowers and harmed parties. Their identity may not be disclosed without their consent, except in cases of extreme public interest.
 	In dealing with political conflicts, the journalist respects the civil rights and freedoms of the participants and the basis of the democratic political system. In doing so, he/she seeks to maintain adequate professional distance.
 	A journalist must not interview or photograph a child (up to 14 years old) without his or her consent and without the presence and consent of the parent or other adult responsible for the child. Even if such consent exists, it is inadmissible to interview or photograph a child if that could jeopardize his or her well-being. The same applies to any other procedure which directly or indirectly reveals the identity of a child. The welfare of the child is superior to the public interest.
 	A journalist may not disclose the identity of a child or a minor involved in sexual abuse or any other form of violence or crime, whether the child or minor is a witness, victim, suspect or defendant. Media coverage of such cases should not allow the identification of a child or a minor. The identity of a child or minor may only be disclosed exceptionally when it is in the public interest and does not jeopardize the welfare of the child or minor, and with the consent of the parent or guardian of the child or minor, or when required for the welfare of the child by government bodies.

INDEPENDENCE OF JUDGEMENT
<ol start=""21"">
 	A journalist must not engage in activities that might jeopardize his independence, objectivity and independence of judgment, afflicting his journalistic dignity. He/she must avoid situations that could lead him/her into a conflict of interest and threaten his/her personal and journalistic profession. The journalist does not accept gifts, services, awards, paid trips, additional employment, work in politics and other benefits that may diminish or call into question his or her credibility as well as the credibility of the journalistic profession. All other situations that may give the impression of his/hers bias should also be avoided. If he/she finds himself/herself in a conflict of interest, he/she must disclose it to the public. The journalist is obliged to resist all forms of pressure by individuals or groups to influence his/her reporting and has the right to inform the public about such attempts.
 	A journalist, like any citizen, has the right to political and other choices. However, in his/her work, he/she takes a professional distance from current events, which is one of the preconditions for objective and professional event reporting.
 	A journalist must not publish information for personal gain. Until the public has been informed of them, the journalist must not use information on financial developments obtained through his/her journalistic activities, for personal interests. If he/she trades with bonds, stocks or similar valuable papers that he/she also reports about, it must be disclosed to the public.
 	A journalist must not be the author of advertisements and other propaganda material, as this calls into question his professional impartiality. The same goes for every other form of participation in advertising and propaganda activities.

EDITORIAL RESPONSIBILITY
<ol start=""25"">
 	Editors of newspapers, radio and television programs, as well as electronic publications that publish journalistic articles, are required to abide the professional ethical principles applicable to all journalists. It is their responsibility to ensure that the advertisements, letters of the readers, as well as all other non-journalistic textual, visual and audio content of the editorial issues comply with the ethical and legal principles of public communication. In electronic publications, where users directly publish textual, visual or audio content, editors are required to provide mechanisms that will prevent or at least restrict the publication of ethically and legally unacceptable content. If they are published, they are obliged to remove them from the issue as soon as possible.
 	An editor must not ask a journalist to work against professional ethical principles.
 	Journalistic articles with substantially altered meaning by shortening or other editorial interventions may be published only with the consent of the author. If there is a disagreement, the author has the right to withdraw his contribution or signature. The editorial board is responsible for a journalistic article published without the author's name or initials or under a pseudonym, as well as for those articles signed by several authors.
 	The editor is responsible for all textual, visual and audio appendages of the journalistic report. The equipment must faithfully express the content of the journalistic report.
 	If incorrect or substantially incomplete information, or information that otherwise violates the provisions of this Code, has been published in a newspaper, radio or television program or electronic publication, anyone who is directly or indirectly materially or potentially harmed by the publication of this information, has the right to rectification. The views of journalists and those of others passed on in a journalistic report are not subject to the right of correction.
 	A correction or rectification, in the part directly related to inaccurate or substantially incomplete information, must be published unchanged, in the same or equivalent place of the media space and in the same or equivalent way as the information to which the correction relates was published in. A correction may be published in an abridged or amended form only if the complainant agrees. The correction must be published in such a way that it is clear that it is a correction, and should not be published among the reactions or letters of the readers, or, the viewers and the listeners, without the consent of the applicant. In electronic publications, the correction and the information to which it relates must be interlinked. It is the duty of the editor to ensure that the correction is published as soon as possible. A comment or response to a correction may not be published with the correction in the same media release.
 	Covert advertising and promotional journalistic articles are not permitted. Whether paid or free, advertisements, like all paid information, must be clearly and unequivocally different from news articles.

FINAL PROVISIONS
A journalist who complies with this Code enjoys the support of his editorial staff and his professional organization. The Statute of the Croatian Journalists' Association set sanctions for violations of the Code. Editorial acts also establish responsibility for the application of the Code to journalists who are not members of HND. HND's Council of Honor is responsible for the protection and implementation of the Code. This Code has come into force on the day of its endorsement at the 50th Assembly of the Croatian Journalists' Association, held on November 27th 2009 in Opatija."

ADDENDUM
EXPLANATORY GUIDELINES
On the basis of the relevant provision of the Journalists' Code of Practice, the Ethics Committee has issued the following explanatory guidelines, cited here in chronological order of addition to the Code:

<strong>1. Publicizing the Names of Traffic or Other Accident Victims</strong>

The Ethics Committee feels obliged to bring to the attention of Press and Electronic Media professionals that, on a number of occasions, the relatives of victims of fatal accidents, either traffic or other accidents and incidents, are put through needless suffering when learning of their loved ones' death or injury on the radio or TV.

The Committee calls upon Media professionals to exercise great caution and responsibility applying the highest professional standards in situations like these, and exercise caution in reporting serious traffic or other accidents without identifying the victims.

<strong>2. Bringing Suspects to Courts - Presumption of Innocence</strong>

The Ethics Committee cautions Press and Electronic Media professionals on the coverage of cases where people either suspected or accused of having committed a crime are brought to court, and recommends the following:

 	Media reporting on such cases must not be in violation of the presumption of innocence and must not contribute to the derision or pillorying of citizens.
 	When pursuing court and police reporting, exaggeration and overpublicizing cases of lesser importance should be avoided.
 	The use of photographs in cases of suspects not yet officially charged must be made with the greatest possible caution and restraint, and only when deemed professionally necessary.
 	The Mass Media and media professionals ought to fully respect the presumption of innocence of people arrested on suspicion of having committed a crime. Based on the legal principle that suspects are presumed innocent until found guilty by a final decision of the court, the Mass Media and media professionals should neither directly nor indirectly assign guilt to the suspect and should avoid any guilt-assigning phrases and characterizations.

At the same time, the Committee feels obliged to bring to the attention of the Minister of Justice and Public Order, and also the Police, that the practice of transferring either suspects or the accused to court in handcuffs (barring exceptional cases or if essential reasons apply) has been abandoned long ago by most countries.

The Committee believes it is high time the competent authorities took this development into serious consideration as this particular practice does not comply with respect of human dignity in a contemporary society.

<strong>3. Publicizing the Names of Rape Victims</strong>

The Ethics Committee finds that significant progress has been achieved regarding the manner in which the Cypriot Mass Media treat victims of rape or other sexual crimes.

At the same time, it notes that there have been cases where even though the victim's identity was not revealed, the publication of information and details relevant to the case either reproduced the sexual abuse or tended to create the impression of the victim's shared responsibility or justify the perpetrator's behaviour. This kind of media conduct is both unacceptable and condemnable.

The principle of non-disclosure of the identity of victims or other details that may reveal their identity applies generally when Cypriot citizens are involved, a fact noted with satisfaction.

It is also noted, however, that this praiseworthy attitude of the Mass Media does not apply in cases where the victims of sexual crimes are non-Cypriots.

There is obviously a false impression among media professionals that since the victims are foreigners and are not known in Cyprus, publicizing their names is not a reprehensible act.

The Ethics Committee feels obliged to underline that the Mass Media ought to deal with incidents of this kind without discriminations and with the same sensibility and respect they demonstrate when Cypriots are involved.

<strong>4. Mass Media handling of drug cases</strong>

The Mass Media undoubtedly play a significant role in shaping public opinion both generally and specifically regarding the use of addictive substances.

The manner in which this particular topic is represented in news reports, footage or articles, or the use of standardized phrases, the publication of photographic material that may cause fear or insecurity or not provide an accurate description of the problem, may have negative consequences and cause the opposite results than those pursued in the context of a policy of prevention.

Proper information and training of journalists on the topic of addictions can contribute to the promotion of the basic principles of prevention policy.

The Mass Media address a diversified pubic that includes groups who may have varied needs regarding prevention. Therefore, the messages conveyed have a different effect on different individuals.

For that reason, there cannot be one single recipe for presenting information through the Mass Media. There is, though, a set of basic principles that need to be taken into account.

<em>Basic Principles</em>

The process of developing and manufacturing drug substances must not be described, as this may be construed as encouragement for the use or instructions for using drugs by individuals prone to the use of substances, or others wishing to experiment. Similarly, there cannot be any reference in a direct or indirect way, to easy or great profit that may be yielded by trading drugs.

Methods of taking addictive substances or instruments of manufacturing or using drug substances can neither be described nor presented.

Not all substances are collectively referred to as WHITE DEATH because not all substances are white and not all lead to death.

Portraying individuals arrested for producing or using drugs as heroes or idols must be avoided.

The use of argot or terms employed by individuals who either trade drugs or are addicted to using them must be avoided.

</ul>
<strong>COMMENTS</strong>

The Ethics Committee, considering that the issue of financial journalism is of crucial importance, intends to denounce publicly and without delay any cases where violation of the aforementioned guidelines has been noted.

The Journalists' Code of Practice and the guidelines issued based on the Code apply both in letter and in spirit. Their intention is clear: No journalist or manager/editor-in-chief should take on any form of activity related to the exercise of financial journalism which leaves room for misinterpretation or may lead to calling into question the integrity of himself/herself or of the Media employing him/her.

No loophole should be sought to justify any action or act that does not comply with the letter and the spirit of the Code and the Guiding Principles.

The Code and Guiding Principles apply for all Mass Media, journalists and managers/editors-in-chief. It imposes upon journalists the obligation to disclose to their managers/editors-in-chief whether they own shares that are newsworthy.

The well-intentioned exercise of journalism requires managers/editors-in-chief to disclose their own interests in shares, as described above, to the Media Publisher/Director. Keeping an Internal Register is a practical manner in which this obligation may be fulfilled.

The basic criterion must be applying common sense. Therefore, the ultimate objective is to protect journalists and journalism from being exposed to accusations for dishonest or self-seeking practices.

<strong>6. Media coverage of suicide cases</strong>

In summary:

News on suicides must not be published or broadcast uncritically, barring exceptional cases where the story is highly newsworthy due to special circumstances.

Where publication is justified, the use of sensational language and expressions or the normalization of suicide or its presentation as a way out of problems must be avoided.

The explicit description of the method or process of a suicide or attempted suicide must be avoided.

Detailed information on the site of a completed or attempted suicide is not to be cited.

Headlines must be worded very carefully.

The use of photographs or video footage must be done with caution.

Particular care must be put on reporting celebrity suicides.

People bereaved by suicide must be treated with due consideration.

A suicide could provide an opportunity to inform the public about the phenomenon of suicide through supplying information on its repercussions on relatives and friends and on where a person may turn for help.

As a general principle, Mass Media do not publish news on suicides, with the exception of rare cases where publication is justified by specific circumstances. For instance, an exceptional case could be the suicide of a well-known personality or celebrity, given that the publication would serve a social purpose or contribute to putting in place corrective measures. However, these exceptions too must be governed by all other provisions of the Code pertaining to suicide.

More specifically, in cases where the facts would justify deviation from the rule, the story must aim at information and not at sensationalism and should not contain details on the reasons or method, nor on the manner or means or process of the suicide.

Even in cases where information is derived from a privileged procedure, such as public court hearings or statements by a person competent to talk about this particular issue, such information must not be published.

There are powerful indications that the Mass Media contribute considerably to the social phenomenon of suicide which is regarded by the World Health Organization as a serious public health problem. The WHO and the International Association for Suicide Prevention-IASP have published a special report addressed to media professionals, which brings together the findings of 50 investigations conducted worldwide: <a href=""https://www.iasp.info/resources/Suicide_and_the_Media/"">https://www.iasp.info/resources/Suicide_and_the_Media/</a>

All investigations have drawn the conclusion that media reporting on suicides can lead to imitative suicidal behaviours immediately after the reporting and within a period of three weeks after.

The general conclusion of these reviews is that similarity between the stimulus and the person described in the story and the reader/viewer in terms of age, gender, financial or personal circumstances and other elements of identification, is an important factor of imitation.

It has also been noted that the more known or influential the person who had committed suicide, the broader was the imitating behaviour that followed. Particular subgroups, such as young people or people suffering from depression, may be especially vulnerable to engaging in imitative suicidal behaviours. The description of suicide by a particular method may lead to imitation of that method.

Where particular circumstances justify media reporting on suicide, the report must not give a simplistic account of the reasons which have led to the suicide. It would be misleading to attribute a suicide to an individual event like exam failure, relationship breakdown or economic catastrophe without delving into other factors. Suicide is never the result of a single cause. Mental disorders, impulsiveness, cultural, genetic and socio-economic factors always need to be taken into account.

According to the aforementioned study, instead of sensationalizing suicide, the mass media should rather have a deterrent effect by presenting the negative consequences of suicide. Such consequences is the devastating impact of suicide on family members and friends who mourn their loss and feel stigmatized and angry or even guilty, wondering whether there had been signs they may have missed.

<strong>7. Presentation of topics about migrants, asylum seekers, refugees and human trafficking victims</strong>

As a general principle, everyone in Cyprus, independent of national, racial, religious, social or linguistic background, has exactly the same human rights based on the international human rights treaties ratified by the Republic of Cyprus.

Recognizing this fact, the Code of Journalists' Practice forbids 'any action containing elements of prejudice based on race, colour, language, religion, political or other convictions, national or social background, property, origin, age, gender and personal status, including physical or mental illness or disability'.

Further, the Code forbids as unacceptable the mocking, pillorying and derision of individuals or groups. This particular provision covers individuals and groups or subgroups of people with different racial, national, linguistic and religious characteristics, as well as characteristics pertaining to personal status, including personal details and features.

The aforementioned properties refer to the individual's right to be different, which must be recognized in practice and be respected by all.

Where issues of migration and asylum are presented by the Mass Media in a manner which contains prejudice regarding the aforementioned properties, the result is the creation of xenophobic feelings which goes on to exacerbate social phenomena rooted on the intolerance of diversity.

An example of the Mass Media creating prejudice is reference to national and racial origin when these characteristics do not form substantial elements of the story. This particular practice is mostly observed in stories concerning crimes or offences or for any other reason reflecting negatively on individuals or groups, where the national or racial origin or solely the fact that the perpetrator or victim is not a Cypriot is underlined in the report. Conversely, in similar cases regarding Cypriots, nationality is not considered part of the story and is almost never mentioned. This particular practice contributes to the creation of feelings of xenophobia, hostility, revulsion and intolerance against foreigners as a whole.

In the same manner, other rights of migrants are often violated, though respected for Cypriots. For instance, the violation of the presumption of innocence, the publication of photographs taken during their arrest or transfer to court, their right"
Denmark;The press ethical rules;2013;"Sound Press Ethics
The content and conduct of the media shall be in accordance with sound press ethics (Section 34(1) of the Media Liability Act).

The Press Council determines whether the conduct of the media is contrary to sound press ethics. Its decision is based on the 'Advisory rules of sound press ethics' which formed part of the Media Liability Bill of 1991, but the 'sound press ethics' standard keeps pace with developments in determination of what is unethical, and adopts standpoints on new situations that arise.

'The advisory rules of sound press ethics were revised on 22 May 2013'

(Adopted at the meeting of delegates of the Danish Union of Journalists on 23-24 April 2013 and at the annual general meeting of the Association of the Danish Media on 22 May 2013).
Fundamental views
Safeguarding the freedom of speech in Denmark is closely connected with the free access of the media to collect information and news and to publish it as correctly as possible. Free comment is part of the exercise of the freedom of speech. In attending to these tasks the media should recognise that the individual citizen is entitled to respect for his/her personal integrity as well as the sanctity of his/her private life and the need for protection against unjustified violation hereof. Visible and clear guidance on how to complain of media content and conduct shoud be made available by the media.

Breach of sound press ethics also includes the withholding of rightful publication of information of essential importance to the public and compliance with outsiders' demands for influence over the content of the media, if such compliance may raise doubt as to the freedom and independence of the media. Furthermore, a breach of sound press ethics exists if tasks that are in conflict with the present press ethical rules are imposed on a journalist.

Journalists should not have tasks imposed on them that are contrary to their conscience or convictions.

The rules cover the editorial materials published in the media. The rules also cover edited discussion contributions. If unedited discussion items are brought, visible and clear guidelines on such items should be published and an effective procedure for handling complaints of such items should be set up by the relevant medium.

The rules also cover advertisements and publicity in the printed periodical press and in the other media to the extent that specific rules governing these have not been laid down.

The rules apply to persons mentioned and depicted, including deceased persons, legal entities etc.
Content of the rules
A. Correct information

 	It is the duty of the media to publish information correctly and promptly. As far as possible it should be verified whether the information given or reproduced is correct.
 	The sources of news should be treated critically, in particular when their statements may be coloured by personal interest or tortious intent.
 	Information which may be prejudicial or insulting or detract from the respect in which individuals should be held shall be very closely examined before publication, primarily by submission to the person concerned. Submission should be made so as to give the person concerned a reasonable time to reply.
 	Attacks and replies should, where this is reasonable, be published together and in the same way. This particularly applies to insulting or prejudicial statements.
 	A clear distinction shall be drawn between factual information and comments.
 	The form and content of headlines and subheadlines shall be substantiated by the article or publication in question. The same rule shall apply to newspaper placards.
 	Incorrect information shall be corrected on the editors' own initiative, if and as soon as knowledge of errors of importance in the published information is received. The correction shall be given in such a form that the readers, listeners or viewers may easily become aware of the correction.

B. Conduct contrary to sound press ethics

 	Information which may violate the sanctity of private life shall be avoided unless an obvious public interest requires public coverage. The individual is entitled to protection of his/her personal reputation.
 	Suicides or attempted suicides should not be mentioned unless an obvious public interest requires or justifies public coverage, and in that case the coverage should be as considerate as possible.
 	Victims of crimes or accidents shall be paid the greatest possible regard. The same rule applies to witnesses and the relatives of the persons concerned. Consideration and tact shall be shown in the collection and communication of pictorial material, including amateur photos.
 	A clear distinction shall be drawn between advertising and editorial content. Text, sound and images generated by direct or indirect commercial interests should be published only if a clear journalistic criterion calls for publication.
 	Special regard should be paid to children and other persons who cannot be expected to realise the effects of their statements or other involvement. Parental consent should be obtained before the publication of interviews or the like when indicated by the nature of the subject and the minor's age.
 	At the collection or publication of information, the confidence, feelings, ignorance, lack of experience or lack of self-control shoud not be abused.
 	Clandestine recordings should only be published if the persons involved have given their consent, or if the interests of society clearly supersede the claim for protection of the individual and it is not possible, or only possible with great difficulty, to obtain the necessary journalistic evidence in any other way.
 	Statements published in digital media will often be available long after their publication. Upon request to the medium, the availability of such previously published sensitive or private information may be hampered if possible and deemed reasonable.

C. Court reporting

 	The general Press Ethical Rules mentioned under A and B shall also apply to court reporting.
 	The rules for court reporting shall also apply to the preliminary steps of a lawsuit or a trial, including the consideration of criminal cases by the police and the prosecution.
 	Court reporting should be objective. At any time during the preliminary stages and the hearing by the court, the journalist should aim at a qualitatively equal representation of the points of view of the parties (in criminal cases the points of view of the prosecution and the defence, respectively). Coverage of a criminal case should be followed up by an account of the conclusion of the case, whether this takes place in the form of a withdrawal of the charge, acquittal, or conviction.
 	Family circumstances, race, ethnicity, nationality, creed, sexual orientation or membership of organisations should only be mentioned when relevant to the case.
 	As long as a criminal case has not been finally decided or the charge withdrawn, no information may be published which may obstruct the clearing up of the case, nor may pronouncements to the effect that a suspect or accused is guilty be published. When reporting on a criminal case, it shall clearly appear whether a suspect or an accused has declared himself or herself guilty or not guilty.
 	To the greatest possible extent, a clear objective line shall be followed in deciding which cases are to be covered, and in which instances the names of the persons involved are to be given. The name or any other identification of a suspect or an accused should be omitted if no public interest calls for the publication of the name.
 	Caution should be exercised in publishing statements to the effect that information has been laid with the police against a person mentioned by name. Such information should as a rule not be published until the information laid has resulted in the intervention of the police or the prosecution. However, this rule shall not apply to statements referred to by the person informed against, or if the information laid is already widely known or is of considerable public interest, or if under the existing circumstances it must be assumed that the information laid was well-founded.
 	A suspect, an accused, or a convicted person should be spared from having attention called to an earlier conviction if it is without importance in relation to the offence concerning which he/she is now suspected, charged, or convicted. Previous criminal charges against a named person should not, as a rule, be mentioned in connection with other news.
"

Finland;Guidelines for journalists and an annex;2014;"Guidelines operative from 1 January 2014

Freedom of speech is the foundation of a democratic society. Good journalistic practice is based on the public's right to have access to facts and opinions.

The aim of these guidelines is to support the responsible use of freedom of speech in mass communication and encourage discourse on professional ethics.

These guidelines concern all journalistic work. They have been drafted specifically for the purpose of self-regulation. The guidelines are not intended to be used as grounds for criminal liability or damages.
PROFESSIONAL STATUS

    A journalist is primarily responsible to the readers, listeners and viewers, who have the right to know what is happening in society.
    Decisions concerning the content of media must be made in accordance with journalistic principles. The power to make such decisions must not under any circumstances be surrendered to any party outside the editorial office.
    The journalist has the right and obligation to resist pressure or persuasion that attempts to steer, prevent or limit communications.
    The journalist must not misuse his/her position. The journalist may not deal with issues that may lead to potential personal gain nor demand or receive benefits that might compromise his/her personal independence or professional ethics.
    The journalist is entitled to refuse assignments that conflict with the law, his/her personal convictions or good journalistic practice.
    When handling issues that concern the journalist's own media, the media concern or its owners, the journalist should make the context of the news item clear to readers, listeners and viewers.
    It is crucial to observe good professional practice when using the work of others. Sources must be mentioned when information has been published by other parties.

OBTAINING AND PUBLISHING INFORMATION

    The journalist must aim to provide truthful information.
    The journalist is encouraged to make known his/her profession during the course of an assignment. Information should be obtained openly. If matters that are in the public interest cannot be otherwise investigated, the journalist may carry out interviews and obtain information by means that depart from standard practice.
    Information obtained must be checked as thoroughly as possible, including when it has been published previously.
    The public must be able to distinguish facts from opinions and fictitious material. Similarly, photographic and sound material must not be used in a misleading manner.
    Information sources must be approached critically. This is particularly important in controversial issues, since the source of the information may be intended for personal gain or to damage others.
    A news item may be published on the basis of limited information. Reports on subjects and events should be supplemented once new information becomes available. News events should be pursued to the end.
    The journalist is entitled and duty bound to conceal the identity of any person who has provided confidential information by agreement with the source. If the publication of information that is in the public interest results in highly negative publicity, it is desirable that the editorial office makes public how the reliability of the anonymous source and the information obtained from it has been assured.
    Headlines, leads, cover and picture captions, sales-promotion posters and other presentation material must be justified by the substance of the story.
    There must be a clear demarcation kept between advertising and editorial content. Hidden advertising must be avoided.

THE RIGHTS OF INTERVIEWER AND INTERVIEWEE

    Interviewees have the right to know in advance the context in which their statements will be used. They must also be told if the interview will be used in multiple mediums. The interviewee must always be told whether the conversation is intended for publication or will be used exclusively as background material.
    It is worthwhile consenting to interviewee's requests to read their statements prior to publication, if the editorial deadline permits. This right only concerns the personal statements of the interviewee, and the final journalistic decision cannot be surrendered to any party outside the editorial office.
    The interviewee's refusal to allow the publishing of his/her statement must be complied with only if the circumstances following the interview have changed so significantly that the publication of the interview could be viewed as unjust.

CORRECTIONS AND RIGHT OF REPLY

    Essentially incorrect information must be corrected without delay and so as to reach, to the highest extent possible, the attention of those who have had access to the incorrect information. The correction must be publicised on the editorial website of the media in question, as well as in the publication or broadcast in which the incorrect information was originally given.

The degree of attention brought to the correction must correspond to the seriousness of the error. If there are multiple factual errors in an article, or if the incorrect information might result in significant damage, the editors must publish a new article in which the incorrect information is identified and corrected.

In terms of the correction of essential information in the Internet, it is not enough that the incorrect information or article is removed, the public must also be told about the error, as well as how and when the correction was made.

It is advisable that the media in question make clear to the public those practices and principles by which they correct their own errors.

    If the intention is to present information about the activities of a clearly identifiable person, company or organisation in a manner that would present them in a very negative light, the object of the criticism must be granted the right of reply on the issue in question.
    If it is not possible to simultaneously hear the views of the parties involved, it may be necessary to give the party who has received the very negative publicity the opportunity to be heard afterwards. If this is not done, good journalistic practice calls for the publication of the comment of the criticised party.
    A right of reply is an intervention that should be published as soon as possible without any irrelevant additions.
    Conventional cultural critique, political, economic or societal evaluation or similar expression of opinion do not, however, warrant a right to reply.
    If the reply is not fit for publication as such, changes should be discussed with the writer. Even if an agreement cannot be reached, it is advisable to publish the essential contents in an objective manner.

PRIVATE AND PUBLIC

    The human dignity of every individual must be respected. The ethnic origin, nationality, sex, sexual orientation, convictions or other similar personal characteristics may not be presented in an inappropriate or disparaging manner.
    Highly delicate matters concerning people's personal lives may only be published with the consent of the person in question, or if such matters are of considerable public interest. Protection of privacy must also be considered when using photographic materials.
    Discretion must always be exercised when reporting on occurrences of illnesses or deaths or on victims of accidents or crimes.
    It is generally acceptable to cover and photograph any event that happens in a public place without having to obtain permission from the subject(s) in question.
    The right to privacy also applies when publishing public documents or other public sources. The public availability of information does not necessarily imply that it can be freely published. Particular discretion should be used when an issue concerns minors.
    The name, photograph or other identifying facts of a person convicted of a crime may be published, unless it is viewed as clearly excessive in terms of the position or action of that individual. The journalist must be particularly careful not to disclose the identity of a minor or person found to be criminally unaccountable.
    Carefulness is required when presenting information that may lead to the identification of the subject in cases where the subject is only considered a suspect or has been charged.
    Information about the convicted, charged or suspected individual should not be published if it may reveal the identity of the victim of a highly sensitive crime.
    The identity of a victim of a highly sensitive crime must be protected, unless the matter is of considerable public interest."
France (IFJ Global Charter of Ethics);Global charter of ethics for journalists;2019;"The IFJ Global Charter of Ethics for Journalists was adopted at the 30th IFJ World Congress in Tunis on 12 June 2019. It completes the IFJ Declaration of Principles on the Conduct of Journalists (1954), known as the Bordeaux Declaration.

The right of everyone to have access to information and ideas, reiterated in Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, underpins the journalist's mission. The journalist's responsibility towards the public takes precedence over any other responsibility, in particular towards their employers and the public authorities. Journalism is a profession, which requires time, resources and the means to practise - all of which are essential to its independence. This international declaration specifies the guidelines of conduct for journalists in the research, editing, transmission, dissemination and commentary of news and information, and in the description of events, in any media whatsoever.

 	Respect for the facts and for the right of the public to truth is the first duty of the journalist.
 	In pursuance of this duty, the journalist shall at all times defend the principles of freedom in the honest collection and publication of news, and of the right of fair comment and criticism. He/she will make sure to clearly distinguish factual information from commentary and criticism.
 	The journalist shall report only in accordance with facts of which he/ she knows the origin. The journalist shall not suppress essential information or falsify any document. He/she will be careful to reproduce faithfully statements and other material that non-public persons publish in social media
 	The journalist shall use only fair methods to obtain information, images, documents and data and he/she will always report his/her status as a journalist and will refrain from using hidden recordings of images and sounds, except where it is impossible for him/her to collect information that is overwhelmingly in the public interest. He/she will demand free access to all sources of information and the right to freely investigate all facts of public interest.
 	The notion of urgency or immediacy in the dissemination of information shall not take precedence over the verification of facts, sources and/or the offer of a reply.
 	The journalist shall do the utmost to rectify any errors or published information which is found to be inaccurate in a timely, explicit, complete and transparent manner.
 	The journalist shall observe professional secrecy regarding the source of information obtained in confidence.
 	The journalist will respect privacy. He/she shall respect the dignity of the persons named and/or represented and inform the interviewee whether the conversation and other material is intended for publication. He/she shall show particular consideration to inexperienced and vulnerable interviewees.
 	Journalists shall ensure that the dissemination of information or opinion does not contribute to hatred or prejudice and shall do their utmost to avoid facilitating the spread of discrimination on grounds such as geographical, social or ethnic origin, race, gender, sexual orientation, language, religion, disability, political and other opinions.
 	The journalist will consider serious professional misconduct to be

 	plagiarism
 	distortion of facts
 	slander, libel, defamation, unfounded accusations


 	The journalist shall refrain from acting as an auxiliary of the police or other security services. He/she will only be required to provide information already published in a media outlet.
 	The journalist will show solidarity with his/her colleagues, without renouncing his/her freedom of investigation, duty to inform, and right to engage in criticism, commentary, satire and editorial choice.
 	The journalist shall not use the freedom of the press to serve any other interest and shall refrain from receiving any unfair advantage or personal gain because of the dissemination or non-dissemination of information. He/she will avoid - or put an end to - any situation that could lead him/her to a conflict of interest in the exercise of his/her profession. He/she will avoid any confusion between his activity and that of advertising or propaganda. He/she will refrain from any form of insider trading and market manipulation.
 	The journalist will not undertake any activity or engagement likely to put his/her independence in danger. He/she will, however, respect the methods of collection/dissemination of information that he / she has freely accepted, such as ""off the record"", anonymity, or embargo, provided that these commitments are clear and unquestionable.
 	Journalists worthy of the name shall deem it their duty to observe faithfully the principles stated above. They may not be compelled to perform a professional act or to express an opinion that is contrary to his/her professional conviction or conscience.
 	Within the general law of each country the journalist shall recognize in matters of professional honour, the jurisdiction of independent self-regulatory bodies open to the public, to the exclusion of every kind of interference by governments or others.
"
France (SNJ);Journalists' professional code of ethics;2011;"SNJ, 1918/38/2011

This relates to the latest version of the Code of Ethics, the foundation stone of the profession, adopted by the National Committee in March 2011 for the 93rd anniversary of the SNJ (French National Union of Journalists).

The public right to high-quality, complete, free, independent and pluralistic information of which we are reminded in the Declaration of Human Rights and the French Constitution, guides journalists in the performance of their jobs. This responsibility to the citizen takes precedence over any other.

These principles and the ethical rules set out below are binding on every journalist, whatever their job, responsibility within the editorial chain or the form of press in which they work.

The responsibility of a journalist cannot, however, be confused with that of an editor, nor exempt the latter from his own obligations.

The activity of journalism consists of researching, verifying, putting in context, prioritising, shaping, commentating on and publishing high-quality information; it must not be confused with communication. Journalism demands time and resources, whatever the medium. It is not possible for ethical rules to be observed without implementation of the conditions that this requires.

The concept of urgency in the dissemination of information, or of exclusivity, must not take away from the serious nature of the enquiry and the verification of sources.

Physical and moral security is the basis for journalistic independence. It must be guaranteed, whatever the contract of employment with the company.

Working in a freelance capacity must benefit from the same guarantees as those which salaried journalists enjoy.

No journalist must be forced to carry out an action or express an opinion contrary to his own convictions or professional conscience, nor to the principles and rules of this charter.

A journalist must accomplish all the activities of his profession (enquiry, investigations, taking photos and recording sounds etc.) freely, have access to all sources of information with regard to the facts which condition public life, and have the guarantee that his sources' confidentiality will be protected.

It is under these conditions that a journalist worthy of the name:

 	Takes responsibility for all his professional productions, even if anonymous;
 	Respects people's dignity and the presumption of innocence;
 	Upholds critical thinking, veracity, accuracy, integrity, fairness and impartiality as the pillars of journalistic activity; considers accusation without evidence, intention to harm, alteration of documents, distortion of the facts, misuse of images, lies, manipulation, censorship and self-censorship or failure to verify the facts as constituting the most serious professional abuses;
 	Exercises the greatest vigilance before disseminating information, from wherever it originates;
 	Has author copyright, which is also a duty, on information which he disseminates, and strives to rectify as soon as possible any information disseminated which proves to be inaccurate;
 	In matters of ethical conduct and professional honour, accepts only the judgment of his peers; answers to the courts for crimes defined by law;
 	Defends freedom of expression, opinion, information, commentary and criticism;
 	Outlaws any unfair or corrupt method of obtaining information. In the event that his own safety, that of his sources or the seriousness of the facts obliges him to conceal his role as a journalist, he must inform his line management accordingly and provide the public with an explanation as soon as possible;
 	Does not accept money from a public service, institution or private company in which his role as a journalist, his influence or his relationships may be exploited;
 	Does not use the freedom of the press with the intention of serving his own interests;
 	Refuses and combats as contrary to his professional ethics any confusion between journalism and communication;
 	Names fellow workers whose work he uses, does not commit plagiarism;
 	Does not solicit a fellow worker job by offering to work under inferior conditions;
 	Maintains professional confidentiality and protects the sources of his information;
 	Does not confuse his role with that of policeman or judge.

Declaration of the rights of man and of citizens (article XI): 'Free communication of ideas and opinions is one of the most precious rights of Man: any Citizen may therefore speak, write and print freely, subject to responsibility for the abuse of this freedom in the cases determined by Law.'

Constitution of France (article 34): 'The Law fixes the rules on civic rights and fundamental guarantees granted to citizens for the exercise of public freedoms; the freedom, pluralism and independence of the media.'

Declaration of the rights and duties of journalists (Munich, 1971): the SNJ, which was behind the initiative to create the International Federation of Journalists in Paris in 1926, is also one of the inspirations behind this Declaration which brings together all unions of journalists at European level."
Germany;German press code;2017;"Guidelines for journalistic work as recommended by the German Press Council

Drawn up by the Deutscher Presserat (German Press Council) in collaboration with the Press associations and presented to Federal President Gustav W. Heinemann on 12 December 1973 in Bonn.

Version of 22.03.2017
<h3 id=""preamble"">PREAMBLE
The freedom of the Press enshrined in the Basic Law includes the independence and freedom of information, the right of expression and criticism. Publishers, editors and journalists must in their work remain aware of their responsibility towards the public and their duty to uphold the prestige of the Press. They perform their journalistic task fairly, according to the best of their knowledge and belief, uninfluenced by personal interests and motives that have nothing to do with the matter in hand.

The journalistic principles define the professional ethics of the Press. These include the duty within the framework of the Constitution and constitutional laws to maintain the standing of the Press and speak up for the freedom of the Press.

The regulations pertaining to editorial data protection apply to the Press in gathering, processing or using information about persons for journalistic-editorial purposes. From research to editing, publishing, documenting and storing these data, the Press must respect people's privacy and right to self-determination on information about them.

These professional ethics give everyone the right to complain about the Press. Complaints are justified if professional ethics are infringed. This preamble is part of the ethical standards.
<h2 id=""section-1"">Section 1
<h4>TRUTHFULNESS AND PRESERVING HUMAN DIGNITY</h4>
Respect for the truth, preservation of human dignity and accurate informing of the public are the overriding principles of the Press. In this way, every person active in the Press preserves the standing and credibility of the media.
<h3 id=""guideline-1-1"">GUIDELINE 1.1
<h4>EXCLUSIVE AGREEMENTS</h4>
The informing of the public about events which are of general interest and importance for forming of public opinion and intent, must not be restricted or prevented by exclusive agreements with informants or shielding of them. Those who seek a monopoly on information exclude the rest of the Press from acquiring important news and thus impinge upon the freedom of information.
<h3 id=""guideline-1-2"">GUIDELINE 1.2
<h4>ELECTION CAMPAIGN REPORTING</h4>
Accurate informing of the public during election campaigns includes the Press reporting on opinions that it does not share.
<h3 id=""guideline-1-3"">GUIDELINE 1.3
<h4>PRESS RELEASES</h4>
Press releases must be identified as such if they are published by the editorial team without any further editing.
<h2 id=""section-2"">Section 2
<h4>CARE</h4>
Research is an indispensable instrument of journalistic due diligence. The publication of specific information in word, picture and graphics must be carefully checked in respect of accuracy in the light of existing circumstances. Its sense must not be distorted or falsified by editing, title or picture captions. Unconfirmed reports, rumours or assumptions must be quoted as such.

Symbolic photos must be clearly marked as such.
<h3 id=""guideline-2-1"">GUIDELINE 2.1
<h4>OPINION POLL FINDINGS</h4>
When publishing the results of opinion polls, the Press shall give the number of respondents, the date of the poll, the identity of the person or organisation that commissioned it, and the questions asked. At the same time, it must also state whether the results are representative.

If the institute was not commissioned to carry out the poll, it should be pointed out that it was implemented at the initiative of the institute itself.
<h3 id=""guideline-2-2"">GUIDELINE 2.2
<h4>SYMBOLIC PHOTOGRAPHS</h4>
If an illustration, especially a photograph, can be taken to be a documentary picture by the casual reader, although it is a symbolic photograph, this must be clarified. For this reason:

 	substitute or auxiliary illustrations (i.e. a similar subject at a different time, or a different subject at the same time, etc.),
 	symbolic illustrations (reconstructed scenes, artificially visualised events to accompany text, etc.),
 	photomontages or other changes

must be clearly marked as such either in the caption or in the accompanying text.
<h3 id=""guideline-2-3"">GUIDELINE 2.3
<h4>ADVANCE REPORTS</h4>
The Press bears full journalistic responsibility for advance reports published in a compressed form which announce a forthcoming story. Anyone who further distributes advance reports by Press organs by stating the source must, basically, be able to rely on their validity. Abridgements or additions must not lead to a situation where the basic elements of the story are given a new slant or prompt incorrect conclusions which may harm the legitimate interests of third parties.
<h3 id=""guideline-2-4"">GUIDELINE 2.4
<h4>INTERVIEWS</h4>
A verbatim interview is absolutely journalistically correct if it correctly relays what has been said.

If the text of an interview is quoted in full or in part, the publication concerned must state its source. If the basic content of verbally expressed thoughts is paraphrased, it is nonetheless a matter of journalistic honour to state the source.
<h3 id=""guideline-2-5"">GUIDELINE 2.5
<h4>GRAPHIC REPRESENTATIONS</h4>
The duty of care requires misleading distortions be excluded in graphical representations.
<h3 id=""guideline-2-6"">GUIDELINE 2.6
<h4>READERS' LETTERS</h4>
1) The Press Code must be observed when publishing readers' letters. It is in the interest of informing the public to allow opinions not shared by the editorial team to be expressed in the Readers' Letters section. 2) Correspondence with publishers or editorial departments can be printed as readers' letters if it is clear, due to their form and content, that this is in accordance with the sender's wishes. Consent may be assumed if the letter refers to articles published by the newspaper or magazine concerned or to matters of general interest. The authors of such readers' letters have no legal right to have them published. 3) It is common practice that readers' letters are published with the author's name. Only in exceptional cases can, at the request of the author, another designation be used. When printing, the Press shall refrain from publishing addresses unless publication of the address serves to respect justified interests. If there is any doubt about the identity of the sender, a letter should not be printed. When taking over user-generated content (Guideline 2.7) in the form of readers' letters, pseudonyms may be retained. However, the source must be indicated. The publication of fake readers' letters is not compatible with the duties of the Press. 4) Changes or abridgements of letters are fundamentally impermissible without the author's consent. However, abridgements are possible if the Readers' Letters section contains a regular notice that the editor reserves the right to shorten such letters without changing the meaning of them. Should the sender expressly forbid changes or abridgements, the editorial department must either comply with that wish, even if it has reserved the right to abridgement, or decline to publish the letter. 5) All readers' letters sent to the editor are subject to editorial secrecy. They must never be passed on to third parties.
<h3 id=""guideline-2-7"">GUIDELINE 2.7
<h4>USER-GENERATED CONTENT</h4>
The Press bears responsibility for all its publications, including user-generated content. User-generated content must be clearly marked as such.

Editors shall ensure compliance with journalistic principles if they detect violations through user-generated content or if such violations are pointed out to them by third parties. In the event that editors select or edit individual user-generated content, compliance with journalistic principles must be ensured from the outset.
<h2 id=""section-3"">Section 3
<h4>CORRECTIONS</h4>
Published news or assertions, in particular those of a personal nature, which subsequently turn out to be incorrect must be promptly rectified in an appropriate manner by the publication concerned.
<h3 id=""guideline-3-1"">GUIDELINE 3.1
<h4>REQUIREMENTS</h4>
<ol>
 	The reader must be able to recognise that the previous article was wholly or partly incorrect. For this reason a correction publishing the true facts must also refer to the incorrect article. The true facts are to be published even if the error has already been publicly admitted in another way.
 	In the case of online publications the rectification is to be linked to the original content. If the rectification is made within the publication itself, it must be marked as such.
</ol>
<h3 id=""guideline-3-2"">GUIDELINE 3.2
<h4>DOCUMENTATION</h4>
If journalistic-editorial research, processing or use of person-related data results in the Press having to publish corrections, retractions, refutations by the persons concerned or to a reprimand by the German Press Council, the publication involved must store them along with the original data and document them for the same period as the original data.
<h2 id=""section-4"">Section 4
<h4>LIMITS OF RESEARCH</h4>
Dishonest methods must not be used to acquire person-related news, information or photographs.
<h3 id=""guideline-4-1"">GUIDELINE 4.1
<h4>PRINCIPLES OF RESEARCH</h4>
Journalists must, as a fundamental principle, identify themselves as such. Untrue statements by a journalist about his/her identity and their publication when doing research work are fundamentally irreconcilable with the standing and function of the Press.

Undercover research may be justifiable in individual cases if in this way information of particular public interest is gained which cannot be procured by other means.

In the event of accidents and natural disasters, the Press must bear in mind that emergency services for the victims and those in danger have priority over the public right to information.
<h3 id=""guideline-4-2"">GUIDELINE 4.2
<h4>RESEARCH AMONG PEOPLE REQUIRING PROTECTION</h4>
When conducting research among people requiring protection, particular restraint is called for. This applies especially to people who are not in full possession of their mental or physical powers or who have been exposed to an extremely emotional situation, as well as to children and juveniles. The limited willpower or the special situation of such people must not be exploited deliberately to gain information.
<h3 id=""guideline-4-3"">GUIDELINE 4.3
<h4>BLOCKING OR DELETION OF PERSONAL DATA</h4>
Personal data gathered in violation of the Press Code are to be blocked or deleted by the publication involved.
<h2 id=""section-5"">Section 5
<h4>PROFESSIONAL SECRECY</h4>
The Press shall respect professional secrecy, make use of the right to refuse to bear witness and shall not reveal informants' identities without their explicit permission. Confidentiality is to be adhered to in principle.
<h3 id=""guideline-5-1"">GUIDELINE 5.1
<h4>CONFIDENTIALITY</h4>
Should an informant stipulate, as a condition for the use of his/her report, that he/she remain unrecognisable or unendangered as the source, this is to be respected. Confidentiality can be non-binding only if the information concerns a crime and there is a duty to inform the police. Confidentiality may also be lifted if, in carefully weighing interests, important reasons of state predominate, particularly if the constitutional order is affected or jeopardised.

Actions and plans described as secret may be reported if after careful consideration it is determined that the public's need to know outweighs the reasons put forward to justify secrecy.
<h3 id=""guideline-5-2"">GUIDELINE 5.2
<h4>SECRET SERVICE ACTIVITIES</h4>
Secret service activities by journalists and publishers are irreconcilable with the duties stemming from professional secrecy and the prestige of the Press.
<h3 id=""guideline-5-3"">GUIDELINE 5.3
<h4>DATA TRANSFER</h4>
All person-related data gathered, processed and used for journalistic-editorial purposes are subject to editorial secrecy. Transfer of such data between editorial departments is permissible. It is not to be done until conclusion of a formal complaint procedure under data protection law. A data transfer is to be annotated with the remark that the data is to be edited or used only for journalistic-editorial purposes.
<h2 id=""section-6"">Section 6
<h4>SEPARATION OF ACTIVITIES</h4>
Journalists and publishers shall not perform any activities that could throw doubt over the credibility of the Press.
<h3 id=""guideline-6-1"">GUIDELINE 6.1
<h4>DUAL FUNCTIONS</h4>
Should a journalist or publisher exercise another function in addition to his or her journalistic activity, for example in a government, a public authority or a business enterprise, all those involved must take care strictly to separate these functions. The same applies in reverse.
<h2 id=""section-7"">Section 7
<h4>SEPARATION OF ADVERTISING AND EDITORIAL CONTENT</h4>
The responsibility of the Press towards the general public requires that editorial publications are not influenced by the private or business interests of third parties or the personal economic interests of the journalists. Publishers and editors must reject any attempts of this nature and make a clear distinction between editorial and commercial content. If a publication concerns the publisher's own interests, this must be clearly identifiable.
<h3 id=""guideline-7-1"">GUIDELINE 7.1
<h4>DISTINCTION BETWEEN EDITORIAL TEXT AND ADVERTISEMENTS</h4>
Paid publications must be so designed that the reader can recognise advertising as such. They can be separated from the editorial section by means of identification and/or design. Furthermore, regulations under advertising law apply.
<h3 id=""guideline-7-2"">GUIDELINE 7.2
<h4>SURREPTITIOUS ADVERTISING</h4>
Editorial stories that refer to companies, their products, services or events must not overstep the boundary to surreptitious advertising. This risk is especially great if a story goes beyond justified public interest or the reader's interest in information or is paid for by a third part or is rewarded by advantages with a monetary value.

The credibility of the Press as a source of information demands particular care when handling PR material.
<h3 id=""guideline-7-3"">GUIDELINE 7.3
<h4>SPECIAL PUBLICATIONS</h4>
Editorial special publications are subject to the same editorial responsibility as all other editorial content. Advertising special publications must respect the requirements of Guideline 7.1.
<h3 id=""guideline-7-4"">GUIDELINE 7.4
<h4>ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL MARKET REPORTING</h4>
Journalists and publishers who research or receive information within the context of exercising their profession shall use this information prior to publication only for journalistic purposes and not for their own personal advantage or the personal advantage of others.

Journalists and publishers may not publish any reports about securities and/or their issuers with the intention of enriching themselves, their family members or other close persons through the price development of the security in question. They should not buy or sell securities, either directly or through agents, on which they have published something in the previous two weeks or on which they are planning to report in the next two weeks.

Journalists and publishers shall take the necessary measures to ensure compliance with these regulations. Conflicts of interest in drawing up or passing on financial analyses shall be revealed in an appropriate manner.
<h2 id=""section-8"">Section 8
<h4>PROTECTION OF THE PERSONALITY</h4>
The Press shall respect the private life of a person and his/her right to self-determination about personal information. However, if a person's behaviour is of public interest, it may be discussed by the Press. In the case of identifying reporting, the public interest in information must outweigh the interests worthy of protection of the persons involved; sensational interests alone do not justify identifying reporting. As far as an anonymization is required, it must be effective.

The Press guarantees editorial data protection.
<h3 id=""guideline-8-1"">GUIDELINE 8.1
<h4>CRIMINAL REPORTING</h4>
<ol>
 	The public has a legitimate interest in being informed about crimes, investigation proceedings and trials. It is the task of the Press to report on these issues.
 	The Press shall only publish names, photographs and other information enabling the identification of suspects or perpetrators if the legitimate interest of the public outweighs the interests worthy of protection of the persons involved in the individual case. Factors that are to be taken into account in particular are: the intensity of the suspicion, the seriousness of the allegation, the state of proceedings, the suspect's or perpetrator's degree of fame, the suspect's or perpetrator's earlier behaviour and the intensity with which he/she seeks publicity. In general, a prevailing public interest may be assumed if:

 	the crime in question is extremely serious or special in terms of its type and dimension;
 	there is a connection resp. a contradiction between office, mandate, social role or function of a person and the action he/she is accused of;
 	there is a connection between a famous person's position and the crime he/she is accused of or if the crime the person is accused of is contrary to his/her public image;
 	a serious crime was committed publicly;
 	an arrest warrant has been applied for by the investigating authorities. If there are reasons to believe that a suspect is deemed to be incapable of committing a crime, the press shall refrain from identifying reporting.


 	In the case of renewed reporting on criminal proceedings lying in the past, as a rule no name or picture of the perpetrator should be published in the interest of resocialisation. The resocialisation interest is all the greater, the longer the time period that has passed since the conviction.
 	In the case of persons involved in the administration of justice, such as judges, prosecuting attorneys, lawyers and expert witnesses, identifying reporting is permissible as a rule if the persons in question are exercising their functions.
</ol>
Publication of the names or photographs of witnesses is generally inadmissible.
<h3 id=""guideline-8-2"">GUIDELINE 8.2
<h4>PROTECTION OF VICTIMS</h4>
Victims have the right to special protection of their identity. Knowledge about the victim's identity is generally irrelevant for understanding an accident occurrence, the circumstances of a disaster or crime. Publication of the name and photograph of a victim is permissible if the victim resp. the relatives or other authorized persons have given their consent or if the victim is a public figure.
<h3 id=""guideline-8-3"">GUIDELINE 8.3
<h4>CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE</h4>
In particular with regard to reporting on crimes and accidents, as a rule the identification of children and young people is inadmissible before completion of their 18th year.
<h3 id=""guideline-8-4"">GUIDELINE 8.4
<h4>RELATIVES AND THIRD PARTIES</h4>
In the case of relatives and other persons who are indirectly affected by a publication and have nothing to do with the actual object of reporting, the publication of names and photographs is generally impermissible.
<h3 id=""guideline-8-5"">GUIDELINE 8.5
<h4>MISSING PERSONS</h4>
The names and photographs of missing persons may be published, however only in agreement with the responsible authorities.
<h3 id=""guideline-8-6"">GUIDELINE 8.6
<h4>ILLNESSES</h4>
Physical and mental illnesses or injuries are part of a person's private sphere. As a rule the press should refrain from reporting about illnesses or injuries without the consent of the affected persons.
<h3 id=""guideline-8-7"">GUIDELINE 8.7
<h4>SUICIDE</h4>
Reporting on suicide calls for restraint. This applies in particular to the publication of names and photographs and the description of the particular circumstances.
<h3 id=""guideline-8-8"">GUIDELINE 8.8
<h4>LOCATION</h4>
The private address as well as other private locations, such as hospitals, care facilities, rehabilitation centres enjoy special protection.
<h3 id=""guideline-8-9"">GUIDELINE 8.9
<h4>ANNIVERSARY DATES</h4>
The publication of anniversary dates of persons who are otherwise not in the public eye requires that the editorial department confirms in advance whether those involved consent to the publication or not.
<h3 id=""guideline-8-10"">GUIDELINE 8.10
<h4>INFORMATION</h4>
If a press report has a negative effect on someone's personal rights, on request the affected person must be given information about the respective personal data stored by the responsible publication organ. The information may be declined if:

 	the data is indicative of the names of persons who are collaborating or have collaborated in the research, processing or publishing of contributions as part of their journalistic work;
 	the data is indicative of the names of contributors, guarantors or informants of contributions, documents and reports for the editorial section;
 	imparting the data obtained by research or other means would negatively affect the publication organ's journalistic mission by revealing the information it possesses; or
 	it otherwise proves to be necessary in order to conciliate the right to privacy with the applicable regulations regarding the freedom of expression.

<h3 id=""guideline-8-11"">GUIDELINE 8.11
<h4>OPPOSITION AND ESCAPE</h4>
In reports on countries where opposition to the government can mean danger to life and limb, the Press must always consider whether, by publishing names or photographs, those involved may be identified and persecuted. Furthermore, the publication of details concerning escapees and their escape may result in relatives and friends who are still in the escapees homelands being endangered, or in still-existing escape-routes being closed.
<h2 id=""section-9"">Section 9
<h4>PROTECTION OF DIGNITY</h4>
Violating people's dignity with inappropriate representations in word and image contradicts journalistic ethics.
<h2 id=""section-10"">Section 10
<h4>RELIGION, PHILOSOPHY, CUSTOM</h4>
The Press will refrain from vituperating against religious, philosophical or moral convictions.
<h2 id=""section-11"">Section 11
<h4>SENSATIONAL REPORTING, THE PROTECTION OF YOUNG PEOPLE</h4>
The Press will refrain from inappropriately sensational portrayal of violence, brutality and suffering. The Press shall respect the protection of young people.
<h3 id=""guideline-11-1"">GUIDELINE 11.1
<h4>INAPPROPRIATE PORTRAYAL</h4>
A report is inappropriately sensational if the person it covers is reduced to an object, to a mere thing. This is particularly so if reports about a dying or physically or mentally suffering person go beyond public interest and the readers' requirement for information. When placing pictorial representations of acts of violence and accidents on front pages, the Press shall respect the possible effects on children and young people.
<h3 id=""guideline-11-2"">GUIDELINE 11.2
<h4>REPORTING ACTS OF VIOLENCE</h4>
In reporting actual and threatened acts of violence, the Press should weigh carefully the public's interest in information against the interests of the victims and other people involved. It should report on such incidents in an independent and authentic way, but not allow itself to be made the tool of criminals. Nor should it undertake independent attempts to mediate between criminals and the police.

There must be no interviews with perpetrators during acts of violence.
<h3 id=""guideline-11-3"">GUIDELINE 11.3
<h4>ACCIDENTS AND DISASTERS</h4>
The limit of acceptability in reports on accidents and disasters is respect for the suffering of the victims and the feelings of their dependants. Victims of misfortune must not be made to suffer a second time by their portrayal in the media.
<h3 id=""guideline-11-4"">GUIDELINE 11.4
<h4>CO-ORDINATION WITH THE AUTHORITIES/NEWS 'BLACKOUTS'</h4>
In principle, the Press does not accept news 'blackouts'. Co-ordination between the media and the police shall occur only if the action of journalists can protect or save the life and health of victims and other involved persons. The Press shall comply with police requests for a partial or total news embargo for a certain period of time in the interest of solving crime, if the request is justified convincingly.

<h4>CRIMINALS' MEMOIRS</h4>
The publication of so-called criminals' memoirs infringes journalistic principles if crimes are justified or qualified with hindsight, the victims are inappropriately affected, and a detailed description of the crime merely satisfies the demand for sensation.
<h3 id=""guideline-11-6"">GUIDELINE 11.6
<h4>DRUGS</h4>
Press stories must not play down drug abuse.
<h2>Section 12
<h4>DISCRIMINATION</h4>
There must be no discrimination against a person because of his/her sex, a disability or his membership of an ethnic, religious, social or national group.
<h3>GUIDELINE 12.1
<h4>REPORTING ON CRIMES</h4>
When reporting on crimes, it must be ensured that any reference to a suspect's or perpetrator's membership of ethnic, religious or other minority groups does not result in a discriminatory generalisation of individual misconduct. As a rule, membership of a minority group shall not be mentioned, unless this is in the legitimate interest of the general public. In particular, it must be borne in mind that such references could stir up prejudices against minorities.
<h2>Section 13
<h4>PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE</h4>
Reports on investigations, criminal court proceedings and other formal procedures must be free from prejudice. The principle of the presumption of innocence also applies to the Press.
<h3>GUIDELINE 13.1
<h4>PREJUDICE</h4>
Reports on investigations and court cases serve to inform the public in a careful way about crimes and other infringements of the law, their prosecution and court judgement. In the process it must not prejudge them. The Press may call a person a perpetrator if he/she has made a confession and there is also evidence against him/her or if he/she committed the crime in public view. In the language of reporting, the Press is not required to use legal terms that are irrelevant to the reader.

In a state based on the rule of law, the aim of court reporting must not be to punish convicted criminals socially as well by using the media as a 'pillory'. Reports should make a clear distinction between suspicion and proven guilt.
<h3>GUIDELINE 13.2
<h4>FOLLOW-ON REPORTING</h4>
If the Press has reported on the unconfirmed conviction of a person, it should also report an ensuing acquittal or a marked lessening of charges if the legitimate interests of the person affected do not dictate to the contrary. This recommendation also applies to the dropping of an investigation.
<h3>GUIDELINE 13.3
<h4>CRIMES COMMITTED BY YOUNG PERSONS</h4>
When reporting on investigations and criminal court proceedings against young persons and on their appearance in court, the Press must exercise especial restraint out of consideration for their future.
<h2>Section 14
<h4>MEDICAL REPORTING</h4>
Reports on medical matters should not be of an unnecessarily sensationalist nature since they might lead to unfounded hopes or fears on the part of some readers. Research findings that are still at an early stage should not be portrayed as if they were conclusive or almost conclusive.
<h2>Section 15
<h4>PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT</h4>
The acceptance of privileges of any kind that could possibly influence the freedom of decision on the part of publishers and editors are irreconcilable with the prestige, independence and responsibilities of the Press. Anyone accepting bribes for the dissemination of news acts in a dishonourably and unprofessional manner.
<h3>GUIDELINE 15.1
<h4>INVITATIONS AND GIFTS</h4>
Even the appearance that the freedom of decision of a publishing house and its editorial staff can be impaired is to be avoided. Journalists shall therefore not accept any invitations or gifts whose value exceeds the extent that is usual in business and necessary as part of working life.

The acceptance of advertising articles or other low-value objects is harmless.

Research and reporting must not be influenced, hindered or even prevented by the accepting of gifts, invitations or discounts. Publishing houses and journalists shall insist that information be given regardless of the acceptance of a gift or an invitation.

If journalists report on Press trips to which they have been invited, they shall make this financing clear.

<h4>PUBLICATION OF REPRIMANDS</h4>
It is considered fair reporting when a public reprimand issued by the German Press Council is published, especially by the publication or telecommunications media concerned.

<h4>CONTENT OF THE PUBLIC REPRIMAND</h4>
The reader must be informed of the facts of the reprimanded article and of the journalistic principle the article violated.

<h4>MANNER OF PUBLISHING REPRIMANDS</h4>
Reprimands must be published in the publications or telecommunications media in an appropriate form. In telecommunications media the reprimands must be linked to the reprimanded article."
Greece;Code of ethics;1998;"In 1998, the Code of Ethics governing the Unions-members of the Federation was passed unanimously at the 2nd Meeting of the Panhellenic Federation of Journalists' Unions (POESY), and adopted immediately by all its members: Journalists' Union of the Athens Daily Newspapers (ESIEA), Journalists' Union of Macedonia and Thrace Daily Newspapers (ESIEMTH), Journalists' Union of the Daily Newspapers of Thessaly, Central Greece and Evia (ESIETHCGE), Journalists' Union of the Peloponnese, Epirus and the Islands (ESIEPEI) and Periodical and Electronic Press Union (ESPIT).
Preamble
The Code of Professional Ethics and Social Responsibility of journalists-members of the Journalists Unions aims to:

 	Reaffirm and ensure the social role of the journalist in the new conditions shaped by gigantism, oligopoly in ownership status quo, the increased range and influence of mass media and the globalisation of communication;
 	Discourage and resist any attempt of state or other party to influence through self-determination of standards of responsible professional conduct;
 	Ensure freedom of information and expression, the autonomy and dignity of the journalist and defend the freedom of the press for the benefit of democracy and society; To this end, journalists commit themselves to applying and defending the following fundamental principles.

Article 1:

The right of people and citizens to inform and be freely informed is inalienable. Information is a public good and not a commodity or a means of propaganda. Journalists are entitled and must:

a. Consider the disclosure of the whole truth as their foremost duty towards society and themselves;

b. Consider distortion, concealment, falsification and fabrication of real events an affront against society and an act demeaning to themselves act;

c. Respect and uphold the distinction between news, commentary and advertising messages, the necessary correlation between title and text, and the accurate use of photographs, images and graphic depictions or other representations;

d. Disseminate information and news unbiased by their personal political, social, religious, racial and cultural views or beliefs;

e. Investigate, with a sense of responsibility and awareness of the consequences, the accuracy of the information or the news which they are to report;

f. Redress without delay, with appropriate presentation and suitable emphasis, inaccurate information and false allegations which are an affront to the honour and reputation of citizens and people, and print or present the opposite view without, necessarily, a rejoinder that would place such journalist in a privileged position vis-à-vis the injured party.

Article 2:

Journalism as a profession, but also as a social service, entails rights, duties and obligations. Journalists are entitled and must:

a. Treat citizens equally, without making any discrimination as to national origin, sex, race, religion, political beliefs, economic situation and social status;

b. Respect the individuality, dignity and inviolable privacy of people and citizens; Only when required by the right to information, they can draw on elements of the private life of individuals who perform a public function or hold a particular position, exert influence in society and are subject to public scrutiny, , always in a responsible manner;

c. Respect the presumption of innocence and not assume the outcome of judicial decisions;

d. Respect the protection of minors and individuals with special needs and serious health problems, as such is provided for by international conventions;

f. Not reveal, directly or indirectly, the identity of rape victims who survived the criminal act.

g. Check and substantiate information concerning sensitive areas of health, where misleading information and sensational coverage can provoke unjustified confusion in public opinion;

h. Gather and cross-check information and ensure its substantiation (documents, photographs, cassettes, television images) by applying legitimate methods compliant with journalistic ethics, always disclosing their journalistic identity;

i. Adhere to professional confidentiality as to the source of the information which was obtained in strict confidence;

j. Respect the standards of off-the-record information insofar as they have undertaken such commitment;

Article 3:

Equal right to speech and pluralism, the lifeblood of democracy, are discredited in conditions of state monopoly control of the mass media and are undermined by the concentration of ownership in the hands of mammoth for-profit enterprises which view public opinion as being a consumer whose views, habits and behaviour by and large, they seek to manipulate; For this reason, journalists are entitled and must:

a. Vigorously defend democracy which ensures free press and the unobstructed exercise of the journalistic profession;

b. Reject and condemn manifestations of state authoritarianism and any arbitrary acts on the part of mass media owners, especially those of oligopolies;

c. Defend editorial independence in their workplace and to refuse to carry out any assignment contrary to the principles of journalistic ethics;

d. Refuse to edit any news, commentary or article and broadcast production at the suggestion of their seniors or employers, if their content does not correspond to reality and to condemn any falsification, unbeknown to them, of their journalistic product.

Article 4:

Surplus of labour in the area of journalism accentuates the preconditions for the manifestation of exploitation phenomena, such as: Unpaid or symbolically remunerated labour, the infringement of contractual obligations and codes of conduct etc. For this reason, journalists are entitled and must:

a. Support and underpin the activities of their trade union organisation aimed at improving remuneration and employment conditions in the mass media;

b. Reject any attempt to restrict their labour rights in the workplace and any violation of ethical standards;

c. Refrain from exercising or accepting any form of discrimination based on sex or years of service of their colleagues.

d. Neither report nor exploit for own benefit exclusive information which influences the course of stock exchange prices and the market;

e. To neither pursue nor accept any monetary benefits and benefits in kind which compromises their credibility and dignity and influences their independence and impartiality.

Article 6:

Solidarity among colleagues and mutual respect of journalists contribute positively to the collective professional objectives and the public image of the journalistic profession. For this reason, journalists are entitled and must:

a. Respect the individuality of their colleagues; Not level unfounded accusations against them and to avoid personal recriminations both publicly and in the workplace;

b. Consider any plagiarism to be a grave and unprofessional act;

c. Not appropriate the work of their colleagues; Always make a reference to the name of the author whose texts or extracts are used;

d. Cite the source of information which has already been published or reported;

Article 7:

b. Avoid vulgarisms, vulgarity and linguistic barbarity, observing, even in satire and caricature, the standards of professional ethics and social responsibility;

Article 8:

The obligations of journalists arising from this Code do not entail any restriction on the freedom of expression.

July 1998"
Hungary;Self-regulatory ethical guidelines;NA;"By joining the Ethical Guidelines, we recognize and defend media freedom.

We declare that the most important tasks of the media are the following: the dissemination of information; the presentation of facts necessary for making informed voter, consumer and parental choices, among other topics; the promotion of free expression and the encouragement of a diversity of opinions; entertainment; and thereby the strengthening of society's self-awareness. To perform all these tasks, journalists need to be able to conduct their professional duty with freedom, without political or economic pressure, fear, or partiality. The signatories of these Ethical Guidelines declare that they acknowledge the obligation to disseminate accurate, fair, and factual information based on their best professional knowledge.
The rules of conscientious dissemination of information
The journalist performs his or her job:

 	accurately, with a conviction of the truthfulness of the content published;
 	impartially, using equal standards to report on actors and cases;
 	without confusing personal conviction with facts, separating opinion from news genres;
 	fairly, respecting the private sphere, human dignity and rights;
 	courageously, without compromise, and undeterred by adverse pressure or threats;
 	free from manipulation, presenting events and processes rather than influencing them;
 	honourably, without trading information, without abusing the power of the public, and avoiding conflicts of interest;
 	by serving the interests of the audience, without being influenced by other interests, and acting in the pursuit of clarity.

The rules of obtaining information and treating sources
The source of information must be disclosed to the audience in a form either connected to a person or an institution, or indirectly, referring to the nature of the source. One must strive to openly reveal the sources, although anonymity is possible if the information cannot be otherwise obtained (see below for detailed rules). The source reference must record all significant factors influencing the information.

Journalists must behave as journalists under all circumstances. Therefore, the journalists need to inform the source as to why they need the information, when, and in what format this information is expected to be published. It is the responsibility of the journalist to inform his or her source of these rules. The only exception can be if the journalist cannot fulfil the requirement of conscientious dissemination of information in any other way, and the importance of the case involved justifies the exception.

Journalists shall not 'business' with information, cannot promise or accept unjust financial or other advantages, and shall not provide confidential information in exchange for information. Journalists shall not abuse the power of the public by extorting information from a person against a promise of hiding other information.

The journalist will do everything to become informed of data, decisions, and documents of public interest through official channels, complying with the provisions of effective media content laws on the obligation to inform, or the laws on the publishing of public-interest data. At the same time, if this official way fails, they are right to obtain the information through informal channels.

The journalist shall not reveal the identity of his or her source if such a promise was made, except if a court or other authority entitled by law obliges the journalist to do so. But even in such a situation the journalist must strive to avoid doing so by legal means.

The journalist and the interviewee consider the interview as a conversation for public disclosure, not as a private talk. The journalist renders the interviewee's words based on the accurate message of the interviewee, which does not necessarily mean a verbatim presentation. The journalist may only provide an opportunity to check the accuracy of the interview, but this does not allow any substantial posterior modification.
Conflict of interest
The journalist must avoid topics, contact sources, and information obtained from sources which inhibit the obtaining and processing of information in an unbiased manner (due to personal connection, bias, or interest). The journalist can undertake an assignment only if it does not raise a conflict of interest, or its semblance, working at the media outlet. The journalist cannot accept a job or other assignment, for financial compensation or not, from an organization, company, or person which might be the subject of the journalist's report. Based on editorial discretion, the nature of the relationship must be indicated to the audience when some kind of personal or institutional conflict of interest would inevitably influence the published material.

The journalist cannot accept tokens of greater value than PR gifts, gifts, or other advantages (especially not, or not exclusively, travel of a professional nature, invitations to a dinner or a lunch of disproportionate value, extraordinary administration, special office treatment, 'journalist discounts') from an organization, company, or person, which would be a subject within a report. When choosing and sponsoring the representative goals and measures emerging during the work, the journalist proceeds according to the rules of reasonableness and decency, but obeys the principles detailed above.

The journalist can accept neither a temporary, nor a permanent income, nor an active role within organizations, parties, companies, in so far as this engagement has any connection with the topics covered by the journalist. This rule is valid in the case of taking or undertaking public offices, or similar commissions.

The journalist, obtaining confidential information during his or her work (particularly financial, economic, commercial, and other pieces of information convertible to personal profit) cannot trade it to his or her personal advantage, and cannot pass the information to a third party before disclosing the information to the public.

The journalist cannot participate in competitions, contests, or be awarded prizes, which are adjudicated by persons/organizations/companies covered regularly during his or her work. It is not a reason for exclusion if the supporters, announcers of the prizes are such organizations, but an autonomous, professional jury should be responsible for evaluating the competitions, or awarding the prizes.

The journalist cannot provide or promise publicity or special evaluation, or defend anyone in exchange for information. Similarly, the journalist should accept neither financial, nor other types of advantage in exchange for publishing or withholding information.

Doing his or her job, the journalist is obliged to communicate according to the norms of social interaction.
Editorial independence, integrity, contact with the media organization
An editorial board is typically a part of a media organization with legitimate business aims. As an employee of the organization, the journalist's job is to promote the achievement of the business aims of the organization, but this aim cannot confront the responsibility originating from the social role of journalism and the ethical traditions and rules reflecting it. Therefore, it is desirable that media companies recognize the editorial boards' integrity and content independence, and the editorial boards and the publishers cooperate to create a harmony between the business aims of the company and the highest standards of ethical and professional rules of journalism.

The editorial board is exclusively responsible for the content of the media outlet. The advertisers and sponsors (either directly or via the colleagues of the media organization) cannot exert pressure overtly or covertly on the editorial board, and such pressure must be rejected. Advertising revenue and advertisements as such are indispensable parts of the operation of the media, and their development seriously influences the strategies of publishers and thus the lives of the editorial boards. But it is necessary that this influence be limited and transparent, and should never influence concrete messages, so that the press can fulfil its role and be sustainable. The media organization cannot instruct the editorial board or its colleagues to prepare or not to prepare specific content, to publish or to reject information in such a way that would breach the principles listed in this code.

Editorial content and advertisements must be separated by clear signs in the media content. In case of product placement, described by law as a form of advertisement, attention must be called to the fact that the content does contain advertising.
Public figures
The journalist respects the constitutional, civil, and personal rights of those actors, with whom he or she communicates professionally. In case of public figures, the boundaries are much broader, but they qualify as public figures only if the case is connected to their roles as public figures, or if acts influence them, thus their role as public figures cannot give a reason for the press to examine every aspect of their lives. At the same time, in the case of public figures, it may be justified to publicly disclose certain details of their private life, family, financial situation, or even their health status if it affects their public duty, or if the public figure has willingly made the information.

The journalist considers the freedom of opinions regarding public figures to be broader than in other cases. It is appropriate to allow tough, or even provocative arguments, in justified cases compliant with the law.

The journalist considers public figures as follows, based on their activities: a) every person holding an elected office; b) every person serving as public officer; c) every person serving public duties; d) every person working before the public (actors, performers of programmes, musicians, other artists, sportsmen, church leaders, businessmen, journalists, university professors, vigilantes, lawyers participating in trials of public interest, leaders of sports clubs, etc.); e) every officer of state-owned companies either directly or indirectly to some extent, of companies in monopolistic positions, or of companies interested in public procurements participating in transactions connected to taxpayers' money.

We do not consider public figures to be those who are not in the public interest, or those who have attained such an interest inadvertently. For example, accident eyewitnesses, the relatives of public figures, crime victims, lottery winners, survivors of catastrophes would not be regarded as public figures.
The rules of keeping contact with other media outlets
The journalist is keenly aware of media competitors, but avoids unethical forms of gaining an advantage and respects their intellectual products. The journalist wishes to win the news competition primarily based on his or her own skills and not by impeding others in reaching information. The resource must be unambiguously indicated in cases of reporting primary sources from other editorial boards. Unauthorised ownership can apply only to new information and a proportionate part of the content.

The journalist complies with the rules of information in handling and keeping contact with public figures, before or even in case of working in collaboration with other journalists. The journalist does not reveal his or her source, and does not misuse the information. Before starting collaboration with others, the journalist clarifies rules with colleagues and observes the rules of correct referencing.

The journalist does not leak confidential or business information about his or her own media outlet, or the inner life of the editorial board.
The protection of personal rights
The journalist places emphasis on not breaching the constitutional, civil, and personal rights of those covered in any capacity during his or her work. The journalist ensures that the actors' personal data, or details of private lives are not published gratuitously (i.e. cannot be justified by public interest or reasonable private interest or is against persons' will) neither in the content nor in other ways, so long as this might affect them adversely in any ways, and the piece of information is not related to their public figure nature. Special attention must be paid to enforcing the personal and deceased rights of reputation of the victims of accidents, catastrophes, and crimes.

The journalist strictly respects the principles of presumption of innocence. Those suspected of crimes are denoted only by their first names and surname initials until a final and binding conviction. The reports do not contain other details, picture, or recordings by which the concerned could be identified. Anonymity may be lifted by the consent of the suspect or the defendant. In case of minor offenders, the complete name cannot be mentioned even after a final and binding conviction. If a public figure is accused of committing a crime, he or she is equally entitled to the presumption of innocence like anyone else, but it is justified and necessary to report his or her name and function. It must always be emphasized if there has been no final or binding conviction made on the reported case. If a media outlet reports about a case without legally binding decision, then it must report the final conviction as well, if the latter is more lenient or essentially different. The journalist proceeds by paying attention to every case when the actor is, for some reason, not in the position to represent his or her own interests fully (minors, the imprisoned, persons with disabilities, foreigners residing in Hungary, etc.).

The victims of crimes and accidents are entitled to a defence. Special proceedings must take place if the victim is a minor.

The journalist must strictly avoid publishing offensive or otherwise extreme arguments about people or groups of people. In justified cases, the journalist might give credence to actors' own opinions of such information.
Shocking content
Gratuitous material designed to shock the audience is to be avoided, be it written, audio, or visual in form. If the transmission of the given information is not solvable without the publication of such contents, then the audience must be informed as to the nature of the shocking content before it is transmitted.

It must be taken into account that easily recognizable brutal or sexual content may be disturbing or shocking for young or otherwise sensitive audiences, but it also may not be easily categorized. Accordingly, the rules described above concern content which offends, humiliates, or evokes extreme fear.
Handling of errors and complaints
If there is no doubt about the incorrectness of the published information (false information, or unfairly represented facts), then the error must be recognized and it must be corrected as clearly and quickly as possible. If the journalist takes information from another media outlet, then it must be accurately referenced. Opportunities for reply must be given to the person about whom the media outlet intends to publish substantive and new information, but this does not mean an obligation to cite any concerns verbatim, or to present it in its full extent.

Editorial boards will examine the complaints of readers, viewers, listeners, which question the principles listed in this document. The result will be disseminated and shared with the audience.

These principles will be regularly revised and, if necessary, amended."
Ireland;Journalists' code of practice;2019;"Preamble
The freedom to publish is vital to the right of the people to be informed. This freedom includes the right of the press to publish what it considers to be news, without fear or favour, and the right to comment upon it.

Freedom of the press carries responsibilities. Members of the press have a duty to maintain the highest professional and ethical standards.

In dealing with complaints, the Ombudsman and Press Council will give consideration to what they perceive to be the public interest. It is for them to define the public interest in each case, but the general principle is that the public interest is invoked in relation to a matter capable of affecting the people at large so that they may legitimately be interested in receiving and the print and online news media legitimately interested in providing information about it.

3.3 Journalists and photographers must not obtain, or seek to obtain, information and photographs through harassment, unless their actions are justified in the public interest.
Principle 4 - Respect for Rights
Everyone has constitutional protection for his or her good name. The press shall not knowingly publish matter based on malicious misrepresentation or unfounded accusations, and must take reasonable care in checking facts before publication.

5.2 Readers are entitled to have news and comment presented with respect for the privacy and sensibilities of individuals. However, the right to privacy should not prevent publication of matters of public record or in the public interest.

5.3 Sympathy and discretion must be shown at all times in seeking information in situations of personal grief or shock. In publishing such information, the feelings of grieving families should be taken into account. This should not be interpreted as restricting the right to report judicial proceedings.

5.4 Public persons are entitled to privacy. However, where people hold public office, deal with public affairs, follow a public career, or have sought or obtained publicity for their activities, publication of relevant details of their private life and circumstances may be justifiable where the information revealed relates to the validity of the their conduct, the credibility of their public statements, the value of their publicly expressed views or is otherwise in the public interest.

Italy;Charter of duties of journalists;1993;"Adopted by the National Federation of the Italian Press and National Council Order of Journalists in Rome on 8 July 1993.
Introduction
A journalist's job is based on principles of freedom of information and of opinions. It is confirmed by the Italian Constitution and governed by the second article of the Italian law no. 1969 dated on 3 February 1963.

Freedom of information and of expression are the inalienable rights of all journalists. They are limited by the observance of the rules of law and subject to the protection of other people's personality. They always follow all duties set by fealty and good faith. The respect of the truth of facts is an unbreakable duty. All incorrect news must be rectified, and mistakes must be corrected.

Journalists and publishers are obliged to respect professional secrecy on the sources of a piece of information, when it is required by the fiduciary character of them; they have to promote the spirit of collaboration between colleagues, the co-operation between journalists and publishers, and the trust in press and in readers.'

The relationship of trust between information organs and the people is the foundation of every journalists' job. To promote and cement this relationship, all Italian journalists sign the following Ethics Code (Carta de Doveri).
Principles
A journalist has to respect, cultivate and defend the right of information for all people; for these reasons he researches and diffuses every piece of information that he considers of public interest in observance of truth and accuracy.

A journalist researches and spreads news of public interest in spite of the obstacles which can arise in his work; he makes any effort to guarantee to people knowledge and control of all public documents.

A journalist's responsibility towards people always prevails above any other thing. A journalist can never subordinate his responsibility to other people's interest and particularly to the publishers' interest, governments' interest or of the other organizations of the State.

A journalist has to respect people, his dignity and his right of secrecy, and he never discriminates between people according to their race, their religion, their sex, their mental and physical condition, or their political views.

A journalist rectifies, swiftly and accurately, his mistakes or his imprecisions in conformity with the duty to rectify and with what is established by law.

A journalist always respects the right of presumption of innocence.

A journalist has to observe the professional secrecy, when it is required by the fiduciary character of his sources. In any other cases a journalist has to respect the transparency of the sources.

A journalist can not adhere to secret associations or act in any way in conflict with the eighteenth article of the Italian Constitution.

A journalist cannot accept benefits, favours or tasks that make dependent his autonomy and his professional credibility. A journalist cannot omit facts or essential details for a complete reconstruction of events. Titles, summaries, photos and subtitles must not either distort reality or change the content of articles and news.

A journalist must not publish images and photos of people involved in daily episodes particularly terrifying, taking care to preserve people's dignity. Nor must he dwell upon details of violence or brutality, unless there is a pre-eminent reason of social interest. He must not interfere with reality to create artificial images.

Comments and opinions belong to the right of speech and of criticism and, therefore, they have to be absolutely free from any obligation, except for the constraint set by law against offence, defamation and violence against people.

A journalist is responsible for his job towards people. He has to favour their dialogue with the ombudsman. He has to create various instruments (reader's guarantee, pages for readers, spaces for reply etc.), giving a wide diffusion to their activity.

A journalist only accepts suggestions and instructions from the editorial hierarchy of his newspaper, as long as the dispositions are not against the professional law, against the national Italian journalist's work contract (CNLG) and are in accordance with the Ethics Code (Carta di Doveri).

A journalist cannot discriminate between people according to their race, their religion, their mental and physical conditions, or their political opinions.

Extenuating circumstances, insulting or denigratory references concerning people and their privacy, are only acceptable when they are of relevant public interest.

A journalist respects the right of secrecy of every person, and he cannot publish news of their private life, unless they are transparent and of relevant public interest. However, he always makes his identity and profession known when he collects such news.

Names of the relations of people involved in such daily events cannot be published, unless they are of relevant public interest; nor can they be made known in case of danger of people's safety, nor can publish other elements be published, that can make clear people's identity (photos, images).

Names of victims of sexual violence can be neither published, nor can the journalist give details that can lead to their identification, unless it is required by the victims themselves for relevant general interest.

A journalist has to proceed with great caution in publishing names or elements that can lead to the identification of members of the legal team or of the police, when they can provoke the risk of endangerment for themselves or their families.

Rectification and reply

A journalist respects the inviolable people's right to the rectification of incorrect news or wrong facts that are considered prejudicial to people's interests.

A journalist makes rectification, therefore, with timeliness and appropriate emphasis, also in case of a lack of a specific required of all news that, after their wide diffusion (spreading), seem to be incorrect or erroneous, especially when the mistakes can damage people, organizations, categories, associations and communities.

When a journalist makes a charge against people, he does not spread news damaging a person's reputation or dignity without giving the opportunity of reply to the person concerned. Should this be impossible (because the person is impossible to find or he doesn't want to reply) he has to inform the readers and the public of this fact. In any case, before publishing a piece of news concerning the investigations' warning by a judge, he has to establish whether the charged person is aware of it.

Presumption of innocence

In all the process and investigations, a journalist has always to remember that every person charged of an offence is innocent until the final judgement. He must not spread news in order to introduce him as guilty person when he has not been judged guilty in such a process.

A journalist must not publish images that present deliberately or artificially as offenders people that have not been judged as guilty persons in a process.

In case of the accused's acquittal a journalist has always to give an appropriate journalistic emphasis to the piece of news, also giving a referral to all news and articles previously published.
Sources
A journalist has to observe the maximum caution in spreading news, names and images of charged people for habitual offences of a minor nature, except in case of particular social interest.

A journalist has to check all information obtained from his sources. He must accept responsibility for what he says, and must always safeguard the substantial truth of facts.

In cases here the sources require anonymity, a journalist has to respect the professional secret and has to be able to inform the reader of such circumstance.

In any other case a journalist must always respect the principle of more transparency of the sources of information, giving the readers or the audience the maximum and possible attention to them. The fulfilment of an obligation to the quotation of a source is particularly important when a journalist uses a piece of news from a press agency or from any other source of information, unless the piece of news is not correct or widely spread with own means, or unless it is modified as far as the meaning and the content are concerned.

In all the other cases a journalist accept conditioning derived from the sources for the publication or the abolition of a piece of information.

Information and advertising

All people have the right to receive correct information, always distinct from an advertising message and not prejudicial to everyone's interests. The advertising message must always be distinguishable from journalistic documents through clear indications.

A journalist has to observe all principles signed in the Protocol's Agreement on Transparency of Information and of the national Italian journalists' work contract (CNLG); he has to make known the advertisement, however, he has to enable people to recognize a journalistic job from a promotional message.

Incompatibility

A journalist can never use economic or financial information that he knows to his personal benefit, nor can he disturb the state of the stock market, spreading news and events that are to his own advantage.

A journalist cannot write articles or news concerning the trend of the market in which he has a direct or indirect financial interest. He cannot sell or buy stock in which he is professionally involved or with which he is going to be concerned shortly.

A journalist refuses payments, refund of expenses, donations, free holidays, duty travels, pleasure trip gifts, or facilities, that can damage his credibility and professional dignity.

A journalist cannot accept tasks which conflict with the autonomous discharge of his own duties, nor lend his name, voice or image for advertising enterprises that are incompatible with the safeguarding of a professional journalists' autonomy.

He is allowed, instead, to give free of charge some services for advertising enterprises, for a social, humanitarian, cultural, religious or artistic task, or for a trade union. However, this must be without a speculative character.

Children or weak people

A journalist respects all principles confirmed in the ONU Convention dated 1989 on the right of children and their rules undersigned by the 'Treviso Ethic Code' (Carta di Treviso) to protect children, their character and their personality, both as an active protagonist and as a victim of a common-law offence and particularly:

a) a journalist doesn't publish a name or any other element that can lead to the identification of people involved in the daily episodes or events; b) he has to avoid eventual instrumentalizations by all adults that brings to represent and make exclusively his own interest; c) however, he values if the spread of the news concerning children brings effectively to the interest of the minor himself.

A journalist protects the rights and dignity of people with mental or physical handicap in analogy with what is confirmed by the Treviso Ethic Code (Carta di treviso) about children.

A journalist protects the rights of the invalid, avoiding sensational publication of news on medical arguments that can bring fear and groundless hopes.

Latvia;Latvian union of journalist’s code of ethics;1992;"Adopted at the Conference of the Latvian Union of Journalists on 28 April 1992.
1. THE ROLE OF THE MASS MEDIA IN SOCIETY

 	Freedom of speech and freedom of the press are basic elements of democracy. A free independent press, radio and television are the most important guarantee of the democratic development of the society.
 	The mass media must defend the freedom of speech and freedom of press. They should not submit to any influence, that can limit the free flow of information and the usage of sources or limit the debate on any issue having significance for society.
 	The duty of mass media is to protect human rights.

2. INTEGRITY AND RESPONSIBILITY

 	The main task of a journalist is to provide society with true and verified information.
 	The facts should be set forth objectively and clearly, stressing major links and with no misrepresentations.
 	A journalist carries a personal responsibility for the information presented and its interpretation.
 	A journalist should refuse assignments contrary to his/ her convictions.
 	A journalist must respect intellectual property and not allow plagiarism.

3. EDITORIAL RESPONSIBILITY

 	As is stated in the Press Law, the editor is responsible for the information presented on radio, on television or in the press. He/ she should guarantee the flow or free and proper information, as well as the free exchange of opinions.
 	The newsroom should guard their integrity, so that they stay free to act independently of any persons or groups who would like to exercise influence on them.

4. RELATIONS WITH SOURCES

 	A journalist has no right to reveal a source without its permission, except if it is demanded by a court.
 	In particular, consideration should be shown for people who cannot be expected to know the consequences of the information and statements they give.

A journalist should care never to take advantage of the emotions and feelings of other people, of their ignorance or their failing power of judgement.
5. PUBLICATION RULES

 	A journalist should be critical in the choice of sources. The information should be checked and statements quoted should be verified.
 	In his writings, a journalist must always respect a person's private life, nationality, race and religion.
 	In the publication, factual information must be clearly and unmistakably separated from comments.
 	There should be clear limits between the advertising and the author's material. The latter should not imitate the advertisements, as such publications create doubts about the objectiveness of the newsroom as well as about the independence of the mass media.
 	Special attention should be paid to using pictures out of their original context. Manipulation is inadmissible, as it generates wrong ideas. A photomontage should be marked as such or in the caption of the picture.
 	A journalist must pay a special attention when reporting from the law courts. The question of guilt should only be settled when a duly enforceable verdict has been issued.
 	If inaccurate information has been printed, an apology for the mistake should be forthcoming as soon as possible and it should be placed so as to be clearly visible.
 	Space should be made available as soon as possible for responses from persons or institutions which have been made the objects of attacks.
 	The author of material is entitled to see it after it has been processed by the journalist and before it is published; it can be published only with the acceptance of the author.

6. JOURNALIST AND SOCIETY

 	A journalist must respect democratic institutions and moral standards.
 	A journalist should stand up for human values - peace, democracy, human rights, people's rights to self-determination.
 	The journalist of Latvia, while respecting the national values of other nations, should hold in high esteem the history, culture, national symbols, independence and freedom of Latvia.

 	We  journalists, producers and communicators of public information  who have gathered at a meeting of the representatives of organisations producing and spreading public information,
 	acknowledging that fair and honest journalism is possible only when a journalist uses the freedom of self-expression ensured by international and national law;
 	perceiving the role of public information media in modern society and of responsibility for our work;

 	understanding that the basis for such trust is independence, fairness, impartiality and professionality;
 	perceiving that respect for correct information and the public right to access such information is the most important duty of a journalist;
 	aiming to strengthen the reputation of the journalist's profession and distancing ourselves from those producers and communicators of public information who tolerate unfair journalism or the principles of unfair competition;
 	protecting our professional honour and independence, while strengthening the self-management of public information media;
 	feeling professional duty and responsibility for freedom of speech and information as one of the most important institutes of democratic society,

The Preamble sets out the national and international legal standards Luxembourg for the existence of this Code of Ethics and conferring its normative force.
<h4>Ad Art. 1 Scope</h4>

<h4>Ad Art. 2 Subject</h4>
Freedom entails rights and obligations. The Press Council, in its mission to defend freedom of the press and that granted during the debates Parliamentarians on the Law of 8 June 2004 on the freedom of expression in the media and especially in the motion of 13 May 2004 by the Chamber of Deputies established with this Code of Ethics rules inherent in the operation the press and the exercise of freedom of expression in the media.
<h4>Ad Art. 3 From freedom of expression</h4>
Section 6 of the Act establishes not only the right to information but also the right to communicate information, to comment and criticize. Freedom of the press is based on the social role assigned to the media and information professionals in a democratic society. This role is search, collect, process, review and disseminate unhindered information public interest necessary for the existence and maintenance of democratic life. The press freedom arises from fundamental freedoms of thought, speech, of expression and opinion recognized in various legal documents, the plan nationally and internationally.

As an extension of the above freedoms, the right to information takes root in recognition of the legitimate interest of the public to be informed. It specifies the conditions for the exercise of a free press in a democratic society, and the prerogatives and responsibilities of those whose primary function is inform. The right to be informed includes the right of the media and journalists to seek and transmit information without hindrance or constraints, and the public's right to access freely.

For this purpose, it is necessary to recall the main principles set out in the Declaration Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention of the Council of Europe. ""All Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression, which includes the right not to freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart considerations impart information and ideas through any expression whatsoever. ""(Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights)

""Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right includes freedom to hold opinions and freedom to receive and impart information and ideas there can be no interference by public authority and regardless of border. ""(Article 10 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of the Council of Europe)
<h4>Ad Art. 4 From the accuracy and truthfulness</h4>
a) monitoring the accuracy and veracity of the information is essential to maintaining high standards of professional press. However, when despite reasonable efforts, given the situation, the information remains doubtful, it must be allowed the press to impart information by hand his doubts. It is the commitment to publish only the information that sources are credible and score information from unreliable sources as such.

b) Section 11 of the Act provides that any misrepresentation of fact contained in a publication must be corrected spontaneously when the inaccuracy on the presentation is concerned is established or when the employee concerned or the publisher had knowledge. The Code of Ethics adopted these considerations.
<h4>Ad Art. 5 Respect for others</h4>
a) This article deals with direct discrimination. Remember about Article II-21 of the draft European Constitution Treaty says: ""Is prohibited any discrimination based on sex, race, color, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, religion or belief, political or other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation. ""

There exist forms of communication, not directly incite discrimination or hatred, can help to create an atmosphere in public negative feelings towards a community. An example drawn from everyday practice is an indication of the color of skin a challenged whenever it is not white. It recommends that the press shows the racial, national or Ethnic a person when this information is necessary to understand the facts or where there is a direct link to the information. It is the same sex, language, culture, social class, disease, physical or mental disability or religious belief, political or ideological person.

b) The press agrees not to defend or glorify acts of violence, brutality or cruelty.

c) Any person, whether public or not known, has a fundamental right to privacy, privacy, dignity and respect for the reputation. The public, its part, the right to be informed about what is in the public interest and the press has a duty the know. Whether in the collection, processing or dissemination of information, media and journalists should exercise caution, discernment and caution. They should worry about actually informing the public, and must be the necessary distinctions between what is public interest and what is the public curiosity. The law about the respect the privacy of the person in Articles 14 15 and a number of conditions that must be observed.

d) The legislature, in various related laws, grants special protection to minors, so as not to jeopardize their social development and family. Journalistic ethics also requires compliance with specific tags in the collection, processing and dissemination of information on minors, specifically regarding their identification.

When the press considers it appropriate to inform the public about legal issues minors, it shall not publish any mention clean to allow identification, whether they are involved as accused, victims or witnesses of traumatic events.

Outside the judicial context, the media and journalists should also be guided in the exercise of their professional responsibilities by the principle of respect the anonymity of youth, including security and development could be compromised. Thus, the press should refrain from giving details that allow the identification of young stigmatized, whether as victims, third innocent or because they live in serious personal difficulties. The law in Articles 18 and 19 on certain provisions of the protection of minors.

e) The Universal Charter of Human Rights because of the presumption of innocence a fundamental right: ""Everyone charged with a crime is presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law in a public trial at which all the guarantees necessary for his defense was insured. ""The press adheres to this principle without restrictions. The law specifies the obligations of the media in the context of legal proceedings in Articles 12 and 13.

However, sometimes the press of business taking place outside seize judicial proceedings, but within the public interest to know. In this case, the press provides with all the usual recautions to respect the presumption of innocence.

In the absence of legal proceedings, the journalists will be cautious before revealing the identity of suspects, unless the suspicions are the result of a rigorous journalistic work to bring to light socially reprehensible acts.

The distinction between legal and business procedures that take place outside the court to explain the wording: "" and avoid publicly present a person guilty of such facts before any official confirmation. ""Instead of usual formulation "" before any final judgment.""

f) The information provided in the media is in the public domain. One can therefore be refer, in reporting the substance or quoted. In terms of information, the work of other media can be useful to journalists. However, the fact that information is disseminated in media does not justify If another media copy or reproduce impunity without mentioning source or without the permission of the author. Not only legislation concerning copyright, neighboring rights and databases that disapproves but it is also a matter of professional ethics.
<h4>Ad Art. 6 From independence</h4>
Necessary to freedom of opinion and expression is provided independence the press. The last day with reasonable care to prevent itself anything that might call into question its independence. Paragraphs of this section dealing with different scenarios that could compromise their independence.
<h4>Ad Art. 7 From secret sources and obtaining information</h4>
a) The law provides for the protection of sources in Article 7. However, some cases that have arisen since the entry into force show that protection remains fragile as those concerned did not yet have the experience and necessary routines. After meeting with the State Attorney, the Council of Press plans to instruct its chairman or the lack of it a vice-Presidents or his duly authorized representative with the mission to attend any searches to ensure, at any place, that the protection of journalists' sources is respected.

b) The press is committed to identifying individuals with sources information and inform, in any given situation, of its intention to communicate to the public the information gathered. This article is intended to alert the people unaccustomed to contact with the press. Individuals must be aware that they are testimonies to a journalist can find their impact to a wide audience.

c) Some codes of conduct are limited to say the ban unfair use ie work under cover for information. If this rule is applicable in most of journalistic work, it can not however be absolute. The scandal of ""Watergate,"" to take one example most spectacular in the history of journalism, would never come to the public knowledge without the use of non-conventional methods. But in many cases, these practices are necessary for many other subjects such as investigations in the consumer interest (test-purchases, eg). The chosen article thus serves to educate the journalist not to abuse these methods, while leaving him the right to the range of methods when interest public demands. Press inform the public use of these means in accordance with the principle of protection of sources and taking into account the interest of the public to be informed the status of the species.
<h4>Ad Art. 8 In the reporting</h4>
a) Generally, the rule adopted by this article is the principle of separation of facts and comment. As Luxembourg, the press release is an opinion, limiting the simple recommendation to separate facts and comments do not seem enough. This leads to the conclusion that physical separation between information and comment is necessary, that is to say, should be published two articles distinct.

However, it should be qualified. When the public can distinguish even within a single article, what are the facts on the one hand, and what opinions journalist and the other comments, the rule is supposed respected. In many cases, the formulation of a title, the use of an adjective is already the expression of an opinion, an evaluation of the journalist. Use these means to attract the attention of the public may be in conflict with the rule. And up to the journalist to be aware of.

b) This provision is justified by the fact that more formal sources of companies bring news services providing media press ""ready"". So the press is it called to be particularly vigilant to enable the public to distinguish between work journalistic and press others.

c) Respect for the right of moral author implies that the name of the author or have a source of information is reproduced.
<h4>Ad Art. 9 From the picture, sound and audiovisual</h4>
Ethical rules apply to all media so as to those of image, sound and audiovisual. It is necessary to set some specific rules on the image, due to the opportunities that arise from technical and enable all kinds of manipulation.
<h4>Ad Art. 10 Electronic Media and the Internet</h4>
The electronic media are a significant and growing importance in the modern information society, so it is worth noting that the code Ethics obviously applies to the disclosure of information by the media.
<h4>Ad Art. 11 From the business and financial information</h4>
a) The announcements and advertisements must be submitted in such a way that the public can not be confused with journalistic information.

b) The press is free to deal independently of topics such as trade, traders, trading companies, products and services, various new markets. Although in these cases the distinction between information is hidden and difficult to advertising, the press must in any avoid because not encourage the purchase. Comparisons and recommendations for products or services based on However, objective criteria are possible.

c) In the context of this article, it is necessary to refer to the specific provisions the law on market abuse. This component is particularly sensitive, the Press Council will ensure that the provisions in this area, existing or future, are sent to the media concerned.

d) Members of the press should avoid removing, directly or indirectly, an advantage or profits inside information which they may knowledge in the exercise of their profession.

Skopje 14.11.2001 Journalists of the Republic of Macedonia"
The Netherlands;Guidelines of the Netherlands press council;2019;"General/Preface
The core task of the Netherlands Press Council is to provide a framework for self-regulation: when and why is journalism prudent and when not?

The Council works on the basis of the Guidelines which describe which requirements journalism must meet and as such clarify to all - both inside and outside of the profession - what can be expected of proper journalists and proper journalism.

<hr />

Media plays an extremely important role in our society, in many different ways and on a great many platforms. They monitor authorities and organisations, institutions and businesses. They play an important role in the democratic process in our society. They offer ample room for proper, sound and independent journalistic work in all its manifestations and in all places. This is how the people they work for - the public, in the broadest sense of the work - are served in the best possible way. Proper journalism can only be performed in full freedom and independently. The freedom of the press is vital. This important role comes with obligations and responsibilities. Journalism that demands full freedom is at the same time transparent about its approach and choices. It brings up own conduct and expressions for discussion, thereby building up trust and creating reinforcing effect. Proper journalism is truthful and meticulous, impartial and fair, verifiable and integer and ethical. It allows itself to be inspected and is transparent when handling comments, responses and complaints. Self-regulation is the most effective way of providing a framework for and give substance to this and accepting that responsibility. The Netherlands Press Council is the expression and instrument of that self-regulation. The Council assesses whether and to what extent journalism has been prudent, within the ethics of the profession. It handles complaints about journalistic conduct.[^1]

The departure point of the Guidelines is that anyone engaged in journalism must take responsibilities for the information he or she distributes and the manner in which he or she operates. This is irrespective of the medium in or the platform on which this is done. The media landscape is highly dynamic and will undoubtedly continue to be so; new initiatives are created in the digital world and outside thereof. The journalistic principles and departure points have a power of expression and force of application in every medium and on every platform.

The Council assumes that all journalistic organisations and all journalists recognise, acknowledge and accept the departure points formulated here. The Council invites everyone else engaged in journalism to adopt the Guidelines as departure point.

The assessment of complaints is the main task of the Council. The main objective is to contribute to the continued rise in quality of journalism in the Netherlands in an open and transparent manner.

The Netherlands Press Council is independent in its work and opinion forming.

<hr />

In their structure, the Guidelines follow the usual course of events for a journalistic product: from initial selection to, ultimately, publication [^2] and archiving - open and transparent in all steps taken during that course.

* This standard can be justifiably departed from in the event of a clear case of malpractice and this is needed to investigate the matter.
A. Departure points
Journalists report truthfully, verifiably and as completely as possible. They avoid one-sided and biased reporting.

Journalists carry out their work independently and avoid (the appearance of) conflicts of interest.

Journalists are free in their choice of what they publish. They weigh the interest of publication against the interests that could be harmed by publication.

Journalists take into account the particular vulnerability of certain groups, such as children (minors) and people with intellectual disabilities.
B. Preparation/Gathering news
B.1 Journalistic approach

Journalists must introduce themselves to potential discussion partners in their capacity as journalists and be clear to them about their journalist intentions. They also do that when accessing non-public areas. *

Journalists do not abuse their position and refrain from inciting incidents with the intention of creating news.

If journalists want to interview someone, they must inform him or her of the nature of the publication, thereby enabling the interviewee to make an informed decision as to whether he or she wants to cooperate with that publication.

Journalists are free to record telephone conversations without notifying their discussion partner thereof. If they, in the interest of their publication, deem it necessary to partly or fully transmit a recorded telephone conversation, they must notify their discussion partner thereof, prior to publication. *

Working with hidden cameras and microphones or with rolling cameras and active microphones is permitted if required in order to investigate malpractices.

B.2 Sources

In principle, sources are referred to in the publications.

Journalists must protect the identity of sources to whom they have promised confidentiality, and of sources with regard to whom they knew or could have known that they have given them information on the assumption that they would not disclose their identities.

Journalists do not pay witnesses and informers; a reasonable reimbursement of expenses can be acceptable.

Journalists do not steal information, nor will they pay for stolen information. *

B.3 Hearing both sides

Journalists must hear those who are disqualified as a result of a publication, even if their role is marginal. Those who are accused must be given ample opportunity to respond to the accusations, preferably in the same publication. Note that hearing both sides does not relieve journalists from their duty to report as truthfully as possible.

The principle of hearing both sides does not apply to publications which seem to contain a personal opinion (e.g. columns, reviews and opinion contributions) and reports of a factual nature, such as reports of public meetings.

B.4 Agreements

A journalist who accepts an embargo request must comply with the agreement until the agreed term has expired. The embargo is lifted if the information provided under the embargo is published in a different medium, or the person who requested the embargo has lifted it prematurely or fails to comply with the agreements made.

Journalists who give the subject of the article the opportunity to inspect the article in advance - in order to correct factual misstatements and remove any lack of clarity - are free to decide how to incorporate comments in the article.
C. Publication
In their publications, journalists must make a clear distinction between facts, allegations and opinions.

Columnists, cartoonists and reviewers are free to express their opinions on events and persons.

Stylistic tools such as exaggeration and deliberate one-sidedness are permitted.

Publications only state the ethnic origins, nationality, race, religion and sexual inclination of groups and persons if deemed required for a proper comprehension of the facts and circumstances that are reported on.

Accusations are only published subject to a proper investigation to establish whether there is a sound basis, certainly so if these accusations are expressed by persons who are in conflict with the accused or who are otherwise affected.

Quotes from interviews may not be used in a context other than can be expected by the interviewee, with a view to what he has been notified of by the journalist. The interviewee must again be asked for his permission to his statements being published, if in the course of the editorial process the nature or content of a publication has changed to the extent that it no longer meets his reasonable expectations.

Journalists who in their publications link to information of third parties need to consider whether the interest served by including a (hyper)link in the publication is in reasonable proportion to the interests that are potentially damaged as a result thereof.

Visual material may not be used by way of illustration in a subject or context other than for which the photographic evidence or footage was made, unless it is clarified why the visual material was used.

Image manipulations may not be misleading. The reader and viewer must be made aware of anything that causes an obvious change to the image.

C.1 Privacy

A publication must not infringe the privacy of persons any more than is reasonably required within the framework of the report. An intrusion of privacy would be imprudent if not in reasonable proportion to the social interest of the publication.

Public figures must accept a certain degree of exposure to unwanted publicity. In their private surroundings, they too have the right to privacy, unless their conduct in their private lives demonstrably affects their public performance.

Journalists must refrain from publishing pictures and broadcasting images of persons in generally non-public areas without their permission, or using letters and personal notes without the permission from those involved. *

Journalists must refrain from bothering, persistently following or tailing persons for prolonged periods of time.

Journalists must prevent information or images from being published as a result of which suspects and convicted persons can be easily identified and traced by the public at large. Journalists are not obliged to observe this rule if the name forms a vital part of the report, if omission of the name on account of the general reputation of the person involved does not serve any purpose, if omission of the name can cause confusion with others who can be expected to be harmed as a result of that, if the name is mentioned within the framework of issuing appeals or if the person involved goes public him or herself.

Publications on serious offences must omit any details of the offence if they are expected to add suffering to the victim or his or her immediate family and if they are not needed to demonstrate the nature and gravity of the offence or the consequences thereof. When approaching the casualties of accidents and disasters and their next of kin, journalists should make allowance for the right of those involved to be left alone. Journalists must act reservedly if the defencelessness or mental state of those involved gives rise to that.
D. Accountability/In retrospect
The editorial office is responsible for publishing letters and responses received on the website of the medium involved.

It is preferred that the editorial office publish the terms and conditions for selection and publication of responses.

The editorial office is free to decide against publishing letters and responses received or to add a postscript to them, unless publication has been promised. Changes and deletions are permitted, as long as the essence and composition are maintained. If the editorial office decides to publish, the period between submission and publication of the response must not exceed the sender's reasonable expectations.

Before the editorial office decides to publish a response that contains a serious allegation, they must verify whether the allegation has a sound basis. The accused must also be given the opportunity to tell his side of the story.

It cannot be expected that all responses are moderated and possibly removed in advance. The editorial office can decide though to remove any responses that have been published. If a response contains a serious accusation or an offensive remark aimed at individuals, the editorial office, on the request of the person(s) involved, must investigate whether there are actual grounds for the accusation or allegation and, if there is not, remove the response.

If journalists are requested to anonymize archived articles or to remove these, then in exceptional cases only will they allow for the public interest of archives of the highest level of completeness and reliability to be outweighed by the private interests of those who make the request.

If it appears that a publication contains misstatements or imputably incomplete, journalists must rectify this appropriately and as soon as possible.
Finally
The Guidelines of the Netherlands Press Council were adopted by its members in April 2007 and amended in April 2008, September 2010, May 2015, June 2018 and December 2019.

[^1]: Journalistic conduct is taken to mean: an act or omission by a journalist in the course of his profession or an act or omission within the framework of journalistic activities by someone other than a journalist who regularly and against payment contributes to the editorial content of publicity media (see Section 4 of the Articles of Association). [^2]: Publication is taken to mean: each form of communication, such as an article, transmission or Twitter message, within the framework of journalistic conduct."
Norway;Code of Ethics of the Norwegian Press;2020;"Ethical Code of Practice for the Press (printed press, radio, television and net publications).

Adopted by the Norwegian Press Association June 13. 2015.

Each editor and editorial staff member is required to be familiar with these ethical standards of the press, and to base their practice on this code. The ethical practice comprehends the complete journalistic process from research to publication.
1. The Role of the Press in Society

 	Freedom of Speech, Freedom of Information and Freedom of the Press are basic elements of a democracy. A free, independent press is among the most important institutions in a democratic society.
 	The press has important functions in that it carries information, debates and critical comments on current affairs. The press is particularly responsible for allowing different views to be expressed.
 	The press shall protect the freedom of speech, the freedom of the press and the principle of access to official documents. It cannot yield to any pressure from anybody who might want to prevent open debates, the free flow of information and free access to sources. Agreements concerning exclusive event reporting shall not preclude independent news reporting.
 	It is the right of the press to carry information on what goes on in society and to uncover and disclose matters, which ought to be subjected to criticism. It is a press obligation to shed critical light on how media themselves exercise their role.
 	It is the task of the press to protect individuals and groups against injustices or neglect, committed by public authorities and institutions, private enterprises, or others.

2. Integrity and credibility

 	The responsible editor carries personal and full responsibility for the contents of the media and has the final decision in any questions regarding editorial content, financing, presentation and publication. The editor shall act freely and independently towards any persons or groups who for ideological, economic or other reasons might want to exercise an influence over the editorial content. The editor shall safeguard the editorial staff production of free and independent journalism.
 	The editor and the individual editorial staff member must protect their independence, integrity and credibility. Avoid dual roles, positions, commissions or commitments that create conflicts of interest connected to or leading to speculations of disqualification.
 	Be open on matters that could be relevant for how the public perceive the journalistic content.
 	Members of the editorial staff must not exploit their position in order to achieve personal gain, including receiving money, goods or services, that can be perceived as compensation from outsiders for editorial benefits.
 	A member of the editorial staff cannot be ordered to do anything that is contrary to his or her convictions.
 	Never undermine the clear distinction between editorial copy and advertisements. It must be obvious to the public what is deemed to be commercial content. The distinction must be obvious also when using web links and other connective means. Decline any commercial content that can be confused with the individual medium journalistic presentation.
 	Editorial mention of products, services, brand names and commercial interests, including the media own, must be motivated by editorial considerations and must not appear as an advertisement. Maintain an obvious distinction between marketing activities and editorial work. Turn down any offers of journalistic favours in return for advertisements. Avoid indiscriminate reproduction of PR material.
 	Hidden advertising is incompatible with good press practice. Commercial interests must not influence journalistic activities, content or presentation. If the editorial material is sponsored, or a programme has product placements, this must be obvious to the public. Sponsorship must always be clearly marked. Sponsorship or product placement in news or current affairs journalism or journalism directed at children is incompatible with good press practice. Direct expenses for journalistic activities must in the main be paid by the editorial department itself. In the event of an exception, the audience must be made aware of what is financed by external interests.
 	Members of the editorial staff must not accept assignments from anyone other than editorial management.

3. Journalistic Conduct and Relations with the Sources

 	The source of information must, as a rule, be identified, unless this conflicts with source protection or consideration for a third party.
 	Be critical in the choice of sources, and make sure that the information provided is correct. It is good press practice to aim for diversity and relevance in the choice of sources. If anonymous sources are used, or the publication is offered exclusivity, especially stringent requirements must be imposed on the critical evaluation of the sources. Particular caution should be exercised when dealing with information from anonymous sources, information from sources offering exclusivity, and information provided from sources in return for payment.
 	Good press conduct requires clarification of the terms on which an interview is being carried out. This also pertains to adjacent research. Any agreement regarding quote check should be made in advance of the interview, and it should be made clear what the agreement includes and what deadlines apply. The editors decide for themselves what should finally be published.
 	Protect the sources of the press. The protection of sources is a basic principle in a free society and is a prerequisite for the ability of the press to fulfil its duties towards society and ensure the access to essential information.
 	Do not divulge the name of a person who has provided information on a confidential basis, unless consent has been explicitly given by the person concerned.
 	In consideration of the sources and the independence of the press, unpublished material as a main rule should not be divulged to third parties.
 	It is the duty of the press to report the intended meaning in quotes from an interview. Direct quotes must be accurate.
 	Changes of a given statement should be limited to corrections of factual errors. No one without editorial authority may intervene in the editing or presentation of editorial material.
 	Proceed tactfully in journalistic research. In particular show consideration for people who cannot be expected to be aware of the effect that their statements may have. Never abuse the emotions or feelings of other people, their ignorance or their lack of judgment. Remember that people in shock or grief are more vulnerable than others.
 	Hidden cameras/microphones or false identity may only be used under special circumstances. The condition must be that such a method is the only possible way to uncover cases of essential importance to society.
 	The press shall as a rule not pay sources or interviewees for information. Exercise moderation when paying a consideration for news tips. It is incompatible with good press practice to employ payment schemes designed to tempt people, without due cause, to invade the privacy of others or to disclose sensitive personal information.

4. Publication Rules

 	Make a point of fairness and thoughtfulness in contents and presentation.
 	Make plain what is factual information and what is comment.
 	Always respect a person character and identity, privacy, ethnicity, nationality and belief..Be careful when using terms that create stigmas. Never draw attention to personal or private aspects if they are irrelevant.
 	Make sure that headlines, introductions and leads do not go beyond what is being related in the text. It is considered good press conduct to reveal your source when the information is quoted from other media.
 	In particular avoid presumption of guilt in crime and court reporting. Make it evident that the question of guilt, whether relating to somebody under suspicion, reported, accused or charged, has not been decided until the sentence has legal efficacy. It is a part of good press conduct to report the final result of court proceedings, which have been reported earlier.
 	Always consider how reports on accidents and crime may affect the victims and next-ofkin. Do not identify victims or missing persons unless next-of-kin have been informed. Show consideration towards people in grief or at times of shock.
 	Be cautious in the use of names and photographs and other clear identifiers of persons in referring to contentious or punishable matters. Special caution should be exercised when reporting cases at the early stage of investigation, cases concerning young offenders and cases in which an identifying report may place an unreasonable burden on a third party. Identification must be founded on a legitimate need for information. It may, for instance, be legitimate to identify someone where there is imminent danger of assault on defenceless individuals, in the case of serious and repeated crimes, if the identity or social position of the subject is patently relevant to the case being reported on, or where identification protects the innocent from exposure to unjustified suspicion.
 	Reporting on children, it is considered good press conduct to assess the implications that media focusing could cause in each case. This also pertains when the person in charge or parent, has agreed to exposure. As a general rule the identity of children should not be disclosed in reports on family disputes or cases under consideration by the childcare authorities or by the courts.
 	Be cautious when reporting on suicide and attempted suicide. Avoid reporting that is not necessary for meeting a general need for information. Avoid description of methods or other matters that may contribute to provoking further suicidal actions.
 	Exercise caution when using photos in any other context than the original.
 	Protect the credibility of the journalistic photograph. Photos used as documentation must not be altered in a way that creates a false impression. Manipulated photos can only be accepted as illustrations if it is evident that it in actual fact is a picture collage.
 	The use of pictures must comply with the same requirements of caution as for a written or oral presentation.
 	Incorrect information must be corrected and, when called for, an apology given, as soon as possible.
 	Those who have been subjected to strong accusations shall, if possible, have the opportunity to simultaneous reply as regards factual information. Debates, criticism and dissemination of news must not be hampered by parties being unwilling to make comments or take part in the debate.
 	Those who have been the subject of an attack shall have the chance to reply at the earliest opportunity, unless the attack and criticism are part of a running exchange of views. Any reply should be of reasonable length, be pertinent to the matter and seemly in its form. The reply can be refused if the party in question has rejected, without an objective reason, an offer of presenting a contemporaneous rejoinder on the same issue. Replies and contributions to the debate should not be accompanied by polemic editorial comment.
 	Beware that digital publication pointers and links could bring you to other electronic media that do not comply with the Ethical Code. See to it that links to other media or publications are clearly marked. It is considered good press conduct to inform the users of interactive services on how the publication registers you, and possibly exploits your use of the services.
 	Should the editorial staff choose not to pre-edit digital chatting, this has to be announced in a clear manner for those accessing the pages. The editorial staff has a particular responsibility, instantly to remove inserts that are not in compliance with the Ethical Code.
"
Poland;Code of ethics of the association of Polish journalists;NA;"By adopting the principles of the Media Ethics Charter and the declaration of the International Federation of Journalists, we recognize that:

 	a journalist is to provide reliable and impartial information, various opinions, and to enable participation in public debate,
 	freedom of speech and expression must be accompanied by being responsible for publications in the press, radio, television, and the Internet,
 	the interests of the readers, listeners, and viewers as well as the public good should take precedence over the interests of the author, editor, publisher, or broadcaster.

I - Information and opinions

 	Information should be clearly distinguished from interpretations and opinions.
 	Information should be balanced and accurate so that the recipient can distinguish facts from assumptions and rumours, and should be presented in an appropriate context, and based on credible and possibly multilateral sources.
 	Opinions may be biased, but they must not distort the facts and be the result of external pressures.
 	Errors and mistakes require immediate rectification, even if they were not the fault of the author or the editors and regardless of whether anyone applied for rectification.

II - Collection and processing of materials
<ol start=""5"">
 	When collecting materials, illegal and ethically reprehensible methods must not be used; hidden cameras and microphones or telephone wiretapping are permissible only in the case of investigative journalism, i.e. tracking of crimes, corruption, or abuse of power, on behalf of the public good and with the knowledge and consent of the journalist's superiors.
 	The private and intimate sphere must not be violated; in justified circumstances, an exception can include activities in the field of investigative journalism, and also for public figures.
 	A journalist is obliged to keep secret the source of their information, including the person and image of the informant if required by the informant with the reservation that the secret may be disclosed only to the journalist's supervisor.
 	The elaboration or summary of information, interviews or opinions must not change their meaning and pronunciation; archival materials and reconstructions of events presented in electronic media should be appropriately marked.


<ol start=""9"">
 	Interviewees should be informed about the use of their statements; permission is required from the interviewee if the interviewee restricts the use of their statements; children's statements may only be used with the consent of their parents or legal guardians.
 	A journalist should show respect for people, regardless of their ideological, cultural, or moral differences which do not comply with the journalist's own views.
 	Consideration must be exercised to not offend people with physical or mental disabilities, the old and the sick, and those who are helpless in life.
 	Particular care should be taken when informing about new methods of treatment that have not yet been fully tested and are only experimental in nature; fortune-telling and horoscopes cannot be presented as reliable information or indicators.
 	The language of speech should be careful, while vulgarisms and obscene terms should be avoided.

IV - Offences and exceptional situations
<ol start=""14"">
 	When disclosing crimes and persons suspected of having committed crimes, extreme caution should be exercised to avoid descriptions that allow for initiation of anti-social acts, and not presume guilt until the court issues a final judgment.
 	When reporting on wars, riots and demonstrations, journalists should maintain an attitude of uninvolved observers, so as not to be manipulated.
 	It is unacceptable to show scenes of death in close-up, and the bloody effects of wars and catastrophes; manifestations of cruelty and violence can be described and shown only on condition of maintaining a balance between the accuracy of the reporting and the sensitivity of the audience's feelings, especially victims' families and their relatives.

V - Conflicts of interest
<ol start=""17"">
 	Journalistic credibility and independence are incompatible with accepting gifts worth more than PLN 200, free trips, or items and devices for testing.
 	A journalist cannot be involved in canvassing or participate in advertising and public relations; the only exception is social and charity campaigns; editorial materials must be clearly separated from advertising and promotional materials.
 	Surreptitious advertising and withholding of information are highly reprehensible.
 	A journalist may not use publicly disclosed information obtained in the course of their professional activity for their own interest, especially in financial and economic journalism.
 	The involvement of journalists in direct political and party activity is also a manifestation of a conflict of interest, and the taking up of such activities and performance of functions in public administration and political organizations is not permitted.

VI - Colleagues and Superiors
<ol start=""22"">
 	Relations between colleagues and associates should be based on partnership. Unfair competition and misappropriation of other people's work or even ideas are unacceptable.
 	The journalist is loyal to his supervisors and publishers or broadcasters. However, they cannot order the journalist, and the journalist has the right to refuse, to carry out orders contrary to the law, their professional ethics, or well-established convictions.

VII - Liability and penalties
<ol start=""24"">
 	The author of the press, radio, television or Internet publication as well as their editor, publisher or broadcaster are all liable for violations of the principles of journalistic ethics.
 	Penalties are imposed by journalistic courts, depending on the nature and scale of the offence, including: admonitions, reprimands, temporary suspensions of rights as a member of the Association of Polish Journalists, and removal from the Association. The Supreme Journalists Court can announce such verdicts in the media.

Journalists must not cause people humiliation or disturb their sorrow.
 	A journalist must not treat people in a discriminatory way, based on their heritage, colour, ethnicity, language, place of origin, religion, political or ideological viewpoints, education, economic situation, social status, age, sex, gender, or sexual orientation.

Romania;Code of professional conduct;2004;"The journalists' Code of Ethics, established by the Convention of Media Organizations
PREAMBLE
This Code of Ethics has been established by member organisations in the Convention of Media Organisations. The provisions of the Code of Ethics are freely consented upon by the journalists and members of the professional, patronage, and trade union organisation signatories of the Journalist Statute adopted by the Convention of Media Organisations in Sinaia between the 9th and the 11th of July 2004. The enforcement of the provisions set forth by the Code of Ethics shall be ensured by the specialised bodies of each organisation signatory of the Journalist Statute. Under this Code, the notion of public interest will be understood as arising from the following premises:

 	Any matter that affects the life of the community is of public interest. This is not limited to political matters but includes any other circumstances of interest to the community.
 	The public interest does not refer only to the matters considered as such by the authorities.
 	The manner in which the government, authorities, or public institutions function and act, as well as any other entity that uses public funds or that affects the interest of the community is of major public interest.
 	All actions, omissions, gestures, and words of dignitaries, politicians, and all civil servants related to the exercise of their function as such are of major public interest. Their private lives are of public interest when they are relevant to the exercise of their respective function.
 	Given the contribution of the authorities to the management of power and public services, any critique brought against them is of major public interest.
 	When there is no clear public interest at stake, freedom of speech can only be limited for the protection of another fundamental right.
 	Any information concerning human rights violations - as defined in the international documents ratified by Romania - is of major public interest.

THE ROLE OF THE JOURNALIST

 	The journalist has the responsibility to exercise the uninfringeable right of free speech based on the public's right to be informed. The journalist enjoys enhanced protection while exercising that uninfringeable right, as the journalist is participating in the vital role of protector of democratic values, which the press holds within society.
 	The journalist has the responsibility to look for, respect, and communicate the facts  as they become known through reasonable research  based on the public's right to be informed.
 	The journalist has the responsibility to express opinions based on facts. In reporting the facts and opinions, the journalist shall act in good faith.
 	The journalist has the responsibility of signalling negligence, injustice, and abuse of any kind.
 	In the journalist's effort to inform the public, the journalist's job is to reflect society as a whole and to reflect its diversity by including minority and individual opinions. The public has the right to know not only the information and ideas that would be received favourably or indifferently or would be considered harmless, but also those that would offend, shock or disturb. These are the requirements of pluralism, tolerance, and open mindedness, without which no democratic society can exist.
 	The journalist profession entails certain rights, obligations, freedoms, and responsibilities.

PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT
1. Respecting human rights

In exercising its role as guarantor of democracy, the primary duty of the press is to respect human rights. Thus:

 	The journalist has the responsibility to respect the presumption of innocence.
 	The journalist has the responsibility to respect the private life of the individual (including those aspects that regard family, residence, and correspondence). Interference in a person's private life to obtain information is permitted only when the public interest in learning that information prevails. In this context, it is irrelevant whether a public person wanted to acquire that status. An activity is not private merely on the grounds that it is not carried out in public.
 	The journalist has the responsibility to bear in mind the legitimate interest of the minor. The journalist shall protect the identity of minors involved in crimes, whether as victims or perpetrators, unless the public interest requires that they be identified in order to protect the best interests of the minor, or at the express request of the parents or legal representatives.
 	The identities of victims of accidents, disasters, crime, and especially sexual assault should not be disclosed unless the victims have given their consent, or when a major public interest prevails. This also applies to vulnerable persons such as the sick, disabled, refugees, etc.
 	The journalist has the responsibility not to discriminate against any person on the grounds of race, ethnicity, religion, sex, age, sexual orientation, or disability, and should refrain from any instigation potentially leading to hatred and violence while attempting to state the facts or express opinions.

2. The rules of editing

 	Factual or otherwise verified information must be clearly separated from opinions. The journalist shall make reasonable efforts in this regard.
 	The journalist shall reasonably verify the information before publishing it and shall express opinions based on facts. Blatantly untrue information, or information that the journalist has good reason to believe is false, shall not be published.
 	When reporting about a matter, the journalist must endeavour to present the views of all parties involved.
 	While editing, the journalist shall respect the rules of quoting. If they partially quote someone, the journalist has the obligation not to alter that person's message.

3. The protection of sources

 	The journalist has the responsibility to maintain the confidentiality of those sources who request to remain anonymous, or of those sources whose life, physical or mental integrity, or workplace could be in jeopardy if their identities were revealed.

4. Gathering of information

 	The journalist shall obtain information in an open and transparent manner. The use of special investigative techniques is justified when obtaining that information would serve the public interest and when information cannot be obtained by any other means. It is recommended that the use of special investigation techniques be explicitly mentioned when publishing the respective information.

5. Abuse of status

 	Using journalistic status for personal gain or in order to favour a third party constitutes a serious violation of ethical standards and is thus unacceptable.
 	The journalist shall not accept gifts in cash or in any other form, or any other benefits offered to them regarding their professional status.
 	The journalist shall avoid conflicts of interest. It is recommended that the journalist separate editorial activities from political and economic ones.

6. Independence

 	The journalist shall exercise the journalist profession according to the journalist's own conscience and in accordance with the principles provided by the Journalist's Statute and this Code of Ethics.

7. Correcting errors; the right to reply

 	The journalist will promptly correct any error that has appeared in the journalist's materials. Where the journalist deems necessary, the journalist may also publish an apology.
 	The right to reply is granted when the request is considered justified and reasonable.

THE JOURNALIST'S RIGHTS

 	The journalist is protected by the international treaties and conventions to which Romania is a party and which guarantee freedom of speech and free access to information as well as all sources of information.
 	The journalist has the right to oppose censorship of any kind.
 	The protection of professional secrecy and of confidential sources is both a right and an obligation of the journalist.
 	The journalist has the right to invoke the conscience clause. The journalist has the right to refuse any journalistic action the journalist deems being against the principles of journalistic ethics or the journalist's own beliefs. This freedom derives from the journalist's obligation to inform the public in good faith.
 	By virtue of the good practice of separating economic activities from editorial ones, the journalist has the right to refuse to obtain advertising or sponsorship contracts for the press institution the journalist works for.
 	The journalist enjoys, according to the law, the protection of copyright privileges.
 	The journalist affirms the right to be defended by the press institution where the journalist exercises the journalist profession, as well as by the professional or trade union association that represents the journalist's interests regarding any pressure exerted against the journalist, i.e., pressure that can lead to a breach of professional conduct as set forth by the Journalist's Statute and this Code of Ethics.

 	respecting changes in the media environment,
 	perceiving threat to moral and value standards of journalistic work,
 	respecting the importance of the ethical rules of journalistic work and the media environment in the Slovak Republic, accepts the Journalist's Code of Ethics ('the Code of Ethics') based on the agreement and consent of the Slovak Press Publishers' Association, the Slovak Syndicate of Journalists and Interactive Advertising Bureau Slovakia (IAB Slovakia) (the representative of internet media) as an expression of binding the ethical standards for journalistic work.

I. THE PURPOSE

 	The purpose of this Code of Ethics is: a) to establish the binding rules of conduct for natural persons and legal entities which issue periodic or non-periodic press in print or digital version intended for dissemination in the Slovak Republic ('media'), editorial board of periodic or non-periodic press in print or digital version intended for dissemination in the Slovak Republic ('the editorial board') and natural persons who carry out the profession or an activity of the journalist in the Slovak Republic ('the journalist'), news agencies operating in the Slovak Republic, providers of information services, internet portals, editorial boards or individuals who accede to it, b) to serve as the guidelines for natural persons and legal entities, such as redactors, commentators, editors, cameramen, photographers, graphic designers and bloggers which are involved in the creation of media content distributed to the public regardless of the technology platform used. c) to inform the public about the ethical rules of journalistic work.
 	Acceding to the Code of Ethics does not prevent media or editorial board from applying own ethical rules that do not contradict the Code of Ethics.

II. THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF JOURNALIST'S WORK

 	Primary values of journalist's work are values of personal freedom, justice and decency. In their work, they promote these values in society.
 	The main principles governing the journalist in his or her work are impartiality, balance, objectivity, honesty, truthfulness, accountability and consistent verification of facts.

 	If the information is not generally known or is not widely known in the sector the journalist is writing about, the journalist is always required to provide a source of his or her information. The journalist is not obliged to provide a source if the source is confidential or secret. The journalist can use such a source in compliance with the provisions of this Code of Ethics about the special source utilization.

If he or she finds himself or herself in a conflict of interest, especially when he or she is working on a topic that concerns or may concern the journalist himself or herself, his or her close persons (§ 116 of the Civil Code) or his or her economic interests, the journalist informs his or her editorial board about this fact. The journalist must not continue to work on the topic with conflict of interest unless the editorial board gives him permission to do so and the journalist informs adequately the public about the possible conflict of interest.
 	If the editorial board finds itself in a conflict of interest, in particular when it informs about media activities or about persons connected directly or indirectly to media, the journalist informs the public about it in an appropriate manner. The journalist must not use the information he or she has gained during his or her work for own benefit as long it has not been published.

"
Slovenia;Code of ethics for journalists of Slovenia;NA;"Preamble
Arising from the freedom of expression and the right to public sector information as the fundamental human rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and international documents regarding the protection of human rights, and from the principles of the Munich Declaration, the journalists of Slovenia, joined together under the Slovene Association of Journalists and the Slovenian Union of Journalists, hereby adopt this Code. The Code contains ethical standards which serve as directives and obligations regarding the work of journalists and other content creators which is published in the Slovenian media, regardless of the work's form of distribution. The compliance of individual actions with this Code is determined by the Journalists' Ethics Council, a joint body of the Slovene Association of Journalists and the Slovenian Union of Journalists. The Code is amended and clarified as per the Recommendations of the Journalists' Ethics Council (N?R).
Journalistic work

 	A journalist has to verify the accuracy of the collected information and avoid errors. Errors that are made - even though unintentional - must be acknowledged and remedied. In this case, the N?R can rule that the journalist was not in breach of the Code.
 	A journalist must avoid the improper or personally offensive presentation of information and facts.
 	When publishing information that contains serious accusations, a journalist shall generally obtain a response from the persons concerned and put this response in the same article or, if delayed, obtain a response as soon as possible. The same must also be done when summarising serious accusations from other media or archives. If the journalist could not obtain a response, this lack of response shall be explained to the public.
 	A journalist must not withhold information crucial for understanding the covered topic.
 	It shall be noted when a journalist publishes unverified information, rumours, or speculation.
 	Whenever possible, a journalist must state the source of the information.
 	When publishing research results, a journalist must state the contracting entity, the provider, and the duration of the conducted research. When publishing public opinion polling results, wherever possible, the sample and method should also be mentioned. If that information could not be obtained, the public shall be made aware of the lack of such information.
 	A journalist can agree to ensure the anonymity of the source of identifiable information. Such a source can be used only if the information could not be obtained in a different manner and publishing it is within the public interest. The journalist shall honour the agreement regarding the anonymity of the source.
 	A journalist shall avoid paying for information.
 	Editing, forecasts, titles, and subtitles must not distort the content. A symbolic or stock photograph shall also be appropriately marked.
 	Plagiarism or forgery of documents is prohibited.
 	* A journalist must not use illicit means of collecting information. If the information which is of the utmost importance to the public cannot be obtained otherwise, the journalist's actions as well as the reasons for them must be presented to the public.
 	* A journalist must always be introduced as a journalist and explain the purpose of the journalist's collecting data. The status of a journalist can only be withheld if the journalist tried to obtain information that serves the public interest but could not obtain said information while declaring the journalist status.
 	* A journalist can record audio or video, and take pictures only after the consent of the person being recorded or photographed has been given. The consent can also be tacit (e.g., if the person does not object). Under exceptional circumstances, a journalist can record and take pictures without consent if the journalist reasonably believes that, by doing so, the journalist shall uncover information that serves the public interest. The reasons for the journalist's decision must be explained in the article.
 	A journalist shall distinguish between information and commentary. The difference between a report on the facts and commentary must be sufficiently clear so that the addressee of the report can distinguish between the facts, and the views or opinions of the journalist.

Electronic publications
<ol start=""16"">
 	The editor-in-chief is responsible for the contents of the commentaries and other audio-visual materials of the readers, listeners, or viewers. The editor-in-chief shall establish rules for the selection and inclusion of commentaries. A commentary that does not comply with the published rules must be removed as soon as possible.

16a. The editor-in-chief is responsible for the transparent supplementation and correction of the contents of online media and establishes the rules. When a journalist or an editor corrects an error, the intervention must be marked in such a way that it is clear what the error was. When an article is merely supplemented with new information, the time of the latest amendment must be evident.
General ethical standards
<ol start=""17"">
 	* A journalist shall respect the right of an individual to privacy and avoid sensational and unwarranted disclosure of the individual's privacy in public. An intervention in the privacy of an individual is justifiable only if the public interest outweighs the respect for privacy. When reporting about public figures and those who want to gain power and influence, and draw attention, the right of the public to information is more extensive. A journalist should bear in mind that collecting and publishing the information, photographs, and recordings of the individuals can hurt those individuals who are not used to the attention of the media and the public.

The journalist must be particularly considerate when mentioning names or publishing photographs and recordings of persons involved in accidents, and offenders or victims.
<ol start=""18"">
 	A journalist shall take into account that no one is guilty until guilt has been proven by a competent authority's decision. If the decision is not final, this shall be noted by the journalist.
 	A journalist must show special consideration when publishing photographs or recordings, collecting information, and reporting about children and minors, persons with developmental, physical, and mental disabilities, and members of other vulnerable groups.
 	A journalist shall avoid ethnic, racial, gender, age, religious, geographical, and other stereotypes, and details related to sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, social status, or other personal circumstances of individuals and groups.
 	Incitement to violence, dissemination of hatred and intolerance, and other forms of hate speech are prohibited. A journalist must not permit such actions and if that is not possible, the journalist must immediately respond to or condemn such actions.
 	In the articles on sexual abuses and family tragedies, a journalist shall not disclose the identities of victims and their family members, and the identities of offenders shall not be disclosed when that action would disclose the identities of the victims. The same shall apply for articles on other criminal offences when minors are included in them. Identities can be disclosed provided there is consent from the adult victims.
 	A journalist shall report about suicide and attempted suicide only if it serves the public interest. In doing so, the causes and circumstances of suicide or attempted suicide are stated with caution. Methods and locations of the deed are not stated. The identity of the person who committed suicide or attempted to commit suicide is disclosed only if it serves the public interest. The exception to this is reporting about historical figures.

Conflicts of interests
<ol start=""24"">
 	If a journalist is personally involved in the events the journalist is reporting about and this therefore presents a conflict of interests, the journalist shall either disclose this conflict of interests, or discontinue reporting the events.
 	Intertwining or joining journalistic and advertising or political propaganda texts is prohibited. Advertising messages, paid publications, and paid advertisements must be recognisably and clearly distinguished from journalistic texts. If there is any doubt, the text must be clearly designated as an advertisement. Hybrids between advertising or political propaganda and journalistic texts are prohibited.
 	In order for a journalist to avoid an actual or perceived conflict of interests, the journalist must refuse gifts, favours, rewards, and other benefits. The journalist shall avoid work outside of the journalist profession which would reduce his credibility or the credibility of the journalist community.
 	A journalist shall not misuse the information on financial events obtained in the journalist's professional work for personal interests. If the journalist trades securities about which he reports, the journalist shall disclose this information to the public.

The rights of journalists and relations with the public
<ol start=""28"">
 	A journalist has the right to turn down a job that is in breach of this Code and the professional standards of the journalist profession.
 	No one shall change the meaning or rewrite the article of a journalist without the journalist's consent. A journalist has the right to sign articles written by the journalist. It is not possible to sign said articles without the journalist's knowledge or against the journalist's will.

* When applying the exceptions permitted by Articles 12, 13, 14, and 17, and when interfering with the rights of others, a journalist must obtain the opinion of the editor-in-chief."
Spain (Andalousia);Ethics of journalism;NA;"Parliamentary Assembly

The Assembly affirms the following ethical principles for journalism and believes that they should be applied by the profession throughout Europe.
News and opinions

 	In addition to the legal rights and obligations set forth in the relevant legal norms, the media have an ethical responsibility towards citizens and society which must be underlined at the present time, when information and communication play a very important role in the formation of citizens' personal attitudes and the development of society and democratic life.
 	The journalist's profession comprises rights and obligations, freedoms and responsibilities.
 	The basic principle of any ethical consideration of journalism is that a clear distinction must be drawn between news and opinions, making it impossible to confuse them. News is information about facts and data, while opinions convey thoughts, ideas, beliefs or value judgments on the part of media companies, publishers or journalists.
 	News broadcasting should be based on truthfulness, ensured by the appropriate means of verification and proof, and impartiality in presentation, description and narration. Rumour must not be confused with news. News headlines and summaries must reflect as closely as possible the substance of the facts and data presented.
 	Expression of opinions may entail thoughts or comments on general ideas or remarks on news relating to actual events. Although opinions are necessarily subjective and therefore cannot and should not be made subject to the criterion of truthfulness, we must ensure that opinions are expressed honestly and ethically.
 	Opinions taking the form of comments on events or actions relating to individuals or institutions should not attempt to deny or conceal the reality of the facts or data.

The right to information as a fundamental human right - Publishers, proprietors and journalists
<ol start=""7"">
 	The media's work is one of 'mediation', providing an information service, and the rights which they own in connection with freedom of information depends on its addressees, that is the citizens.
 	Information is a fundamental right which has been highlighted by the case-law of the European Commission and Court of Human Rights relating to Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights and recognised under Article 9 of the European Convention on Transfrontier Television, as well as in all democratic constitutions. The owner of the right is the citizen, who also has the related right to demand that the information supplied by journalists be conveyed truthfully, in the case of news, and honestly, in the case of opinions, without outside interference by either the public authorities or the private sector.
 	The public authorities must not consider that they own information. The representativeness of such authorities provides the legal basis for efforts to guarantee and extend pluralism in the media and to ensure that the necessary conditions are created for exercising freedom of expression and the right to information and precluding censorship. Moreover, the Committee of Ministers is aware of this fact, as demonstrated by its Declaration on the Freedom of Expression and Information adopted on 29 April 1982.
 	When dealing with journalism it must be borne in mind that it relies on the media, which are part of a corporate structure within which a distinction must be made between publishers, proprietors and journalists. To that end, in addition to safeguarding the freedom of the media, freedom within the media must also be protected and internal pressures guarded against.
 	News organisations must consider themselves as special socio-economic agencies whose entrepreneurial objectives have to be limited by the conditions for providing access to a fundamental right.
 	News organisations must show transparency in matters of media ownership and management, enabling citizens to ascertain clearly the identity of proprietors and the extent of their economic interest in the media.
 	Inside the news organisation, publishers and journalists must co-exist, bearing in mind that the legitimate respect for publishers' and owners' ideological orientations is limited by the absolute requirements on truthful news reporting and ethical opinions. This is essential if we are to respect the citizens' fundamental right to information.
 	These requirements are such that we must reinforce the safeguards of the journalist's freedom of expression, for they must in the last instance operate as the ultimate sources of information. In this connection we must legally expand and clarify the nature of the conscience clause and professional secrecy vis-a-vis confidential sources, harmonising national provisions on this matter so that they can be implemented in the wider context of democratic Europe.
 	Neither publishers and proprietors nor journalists should consider that they own the news. News organisations must treat information not as a commodity but as a fundamental right of the citizen. To that end, the media should exploit neither the quality nor the substance of the news or opinions for purposes of boosting readership or audience figures in order to increase advertising revenue.
 	If we are to ensure that information is treated ethically, its target audience must be considered as individuals and not as a mass.

The function of journalism and its ethical activity
<ol start=""17"">
 	Information and communication as conveyed by journalism through the media, with powerful support from the new technologies, has decisive importance for the development of the individual and society. It is indispensable for democratic life, since if democracy is to develop fully it must guarantee citizens participation in public affairs. Suffice it to say that such participation would be impossible if the citizens were not in receipt of the information on public affairs which they need and which must be provided by the media.
 	The importance of information, especially radio and television news, for culture and education was highlighted in Assembly Recommendation 1067. Its effects on public opinion are obvious.
 	It would be wrong to infer from the importance of this role that the media actually represent public opinion or that they should replace the specific functions of the public authorities or institutions of an educational or cultural character such as schools.
 	This would amount to transforming the media and journalism into authorities or counter-authorities ('mediocracy'), even though they would not be representative of the citizens or subject to the same democratic controls as the public authorities, and would not possess the specialist knowledge of the corresponding cultural or educational institutions.
 	Therefore journalism should not alter truthful, impartial information or honest opinions, or exploit them for media purposes, in an attempt to create or shape public opinion, since its legitimacy rests on effective respect for the citizen's fundamental right to information as part of respect for democratic values. To that end, legitimate investigative journalism is limited by the veracity and honesty of information and opinions and is incompatible with journalistic campaigns conducted on the basis of previously adopted positions and special interests.
 	In journalism, information and opinions must respect the presumption of innocence, in particular in cases which are still sub judice, and must refrain from making judgments.
 	The right of individuals to privacy must be respected. Persons holding office in public life are entitled to protection for their privacy except in those cases where their private life may have an effect on their public life. The fact that a person holds a public post does not deprive him of the right to respect for his privacy.
 	The attempt to strike a balance between the right to respect for private life, enshrined in Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and the freedom of expression set forth in Article 10, is well documented in the recent case-law of the European Commission and Court of Human Rights.
 	In the journalist's profession the end does not justify the means; therefore information must be obtained by legal and ethical means.
 	At the request of the persons concerned, the news media must correct, automatically and speedily, and with all relevant information provided, any news item or opinion conveyed by them which is false or erroneous. National legislation should provide for appropriate sanctions and, where applicable, compensation.
 	In order to harmonise the application and exercise of this right in the member states of the Council of Europe, we must implement Resolution (74) 26 on the right of reply _ Position of the individual in relation to the press, adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 2 July 1974, and also the relevant provisions of the European Convention on Transfrontier Television.
 	In order to ensure high-quality work and independence on the part of journalists, they must be guaranteed decent pay and proper working conditions and facilities.
 	In the relations which the journalist must maintain in the course of his duties with the public authorities or the various economic sectors, care should be taken to avoid any kind of connivance liable to affect the independence and impartiality of journalism.
 	In journalism, controversial or sensational items must not be confused with subjects on which it is important to provide information. The journalist must not exploit his duties for the principal purpose of acquiring prestige or personal influence.
 	In view of the complexity of the process of providing information, which is increasingly based on the use of new technologies, speed and conciseness, journalists must be required to have appropriate professional training.

Rules governing editorial staff
<ol start=""32"">
 	Within the newspaper business, publishers, proprietors and journalists must live side by side. To that end, rules must be drawn up for editorial staff in order to regulate professional relations between the journalists and the publishers and proprietors within the media, separately from the normal requirements of labour relations. Such rules might provide for the setting up of editorial boards.

Situations of conflict and cases of special protection
<ol start=""33"">
 	In society, situations of tension and conflict sometimes arise under the pressure of factors such as terrorism, discrimination against minorities, xenophobia or war. In such circumstances the media have a moral obligation to defend democratic values: respect for human dignity, solving problems by peaceful, tolerant means, and consequently to oppose violence and the language of hatred and confrontation and to reject all discrimination based on culture, sex or religion.
 	No-one should remain neutral vis-à-vis the defence of democratic values. To that end the media must play a major role in preventing tension and must encourage mutual understanding, tolerance and trust between the various communities in regions where conflict prevails, as the Secretary General of the Council of Europe has set out to do with her confidence-building measures in the former Yugoslavia.
 	Having regard to the very specific influence of the media, notably television, on the attitudes of children and young people, care must be taken not to broadcast programmes, messages or images glorifying violence, exploiting sex and consumerism or using deliberately unsuitable language.

Ethics and self-regulation in journalism
<ol start=""36"">
 	Having regard to the requisite conditions and basic principles enumerated above, the media must undertake to submit to firm ethical principles guaranteeing freedom of expression and the fundamental right of citizens to receive truthful information and honest opinions.
 	In order to supervise the implementation of these principles, self-regulatory bodies or mechanisms must be set up comprising publishers, journalists, media users' associations, experts from the academic world and judges; they will be responsible for issuing resolutions on respect for ethical precepts in journalism, with prior commitment on the part of the media to publish the relevant resolutions. This will help the citizen, who has the right to information, to pass either positive or negative judgment on the journalist's work and credibility.
 	The self-regulatory bodies or mechanisms, the media users' associations and the relevant university departments could publish each year the research done a posteriori on the truthfulness of the information broadcast by the media, comparing the news with the actual facts. This would serve as a barometer of credibility which citizens could use as a guide to the ethical standard achieved by each medium or each section of the media, or even each individual journalist. The relevant corrective mechanisms might simultaneously help improve the manner in which the profession of media journalism is pursued.

Spain (Catalunia);Code of ethics;2016;"Declaration of Principles of Professional Journalists in Catalonia

The Code of Ethics sets out the rules that newspapers and other media have agreed to follow regulated by CIC, an independent body created in 1997 by the Catalan Society of Professional Journalists (Col·legi de Periodistes de Catalunya). The Code was written in 1992 and the latest version was updated on 9 November 2016. It sets the framework for the professional standards that members of the press, in printed and online version, have undertaken to maintain as the system of voluntary self-regulation. The Code balances both the rights of the individual and the public's right to know, and it is the responsibility of editors, publishers and journalists to apply it in their publications.
CRITERIA
The journalists should:

1. Report with accuracy and precision

The professional journalists are committed to the pursuit of the truth and, consequently, they have the obligation to report the reality of the events with the highest fidelity possible. The media always have to maintain a clear distinction between fact and opinion, disclose only information that's been verified with due diligence and avoid spreading conjectures and rumours as if they were facts.

2. Avoid harm due to information without sufficient basis

The journalists should not use abusive expressions nor disclose facts that are imprecise or without sufficient basis and that may injure the dignity of people and cause harm or discredit to public or private entities.

The journalists must contact previously with those who could be affected, providing them the opportunity to reply.

3. Rectify incorrect information

The journalists have the obligation to amend both the information and the resulting interpretations that have been proven false or wrong, and that should be done promptly and with an appropriate treatment and extent. At the same time, the media must meet the right of reply when this is requested on reasonable terms.

4. Use legitimate and worthy methods to obtain information

The use of hidden cameras and any other surreptitious or misleading procedure to obtain information, pictures and testimonies is unacceptable. The interception and revelation without consent of private material obtained from mobile telephones, electronic messaging and other communication devices is also unacceptable.

An exemption could be granted in case of incidents or events of unequivocal public interest, when there is no other option left to comply appropriately with the right to information.

Paying sources for information goes against the good journalistic practice and it is inadmissible when it endangers the principle of truthfulness or when it is likely to interfere with the action of Justice.

Plagiarism is unacceptable. It is necessary to apply the proper professional practices when using others' work.

5. Cite the sources and preserve the professional secrecy

To assure the credibility of the information, the sources must be quoted. However, journalists have the moral obligation to protect them by invoking professional secrecy when necessary. Confidentiality is useful to protect people in a situation of vulnerability or risk, but in no case the anonymity can be used for unjustified attacks against individuals and organizations.

Good journalistic practice requires also an appropriately treatment of the information received under embargo, as well as to respect the off the record agreement.

6. Reconcile the individual rights with the public right to know

The journalist must defend the right to information in front of any restriction to the transparency required by the public interest, especially when the sources are government institutions and agencies. However, one must concede the individual and legal persons the right not to provide any information or to answer questions. Intimidating and persistent harassment is a reprehensible practice.

7. Avoid conflict of interests

The journalists should never accept payments or rewards by third parties that intend to promote, orient or get published certain information and opinions. The acceptance of promotional or commemorative gifts can never exceed the strict criteria of courtesy, according to the scale established by the journalistic organizations. It is not admissible to practise journalism simultaneously with other paid activities that endanger the principles of truthfulness and independence.

It is necessary to refuse formulas of promotion or advertising under the deliberate appearance of journalistic information.

As a general rule, the information professionals should avoid any situation of conflict of interests, whether political, commercial, economic, financial or familiar, that calls into question the credibility and impartiality of his role.

8. Not use privileged information for one's own good

The journalists should not use in their own benefit the information received confidentially in the exercise of their function, regardless of whether it is published or not, nor pass it on to third parties for similar reasons. They also should avoid pronouncing on companies and products in which they have some financial interest, either directly or through family members or people they know well. The same rules should apply regarding the betting and gaming industry.

9. Respect the right to privacy

People should be treated with respect and dignity, particularly the most vulnerable ones. Unnecessary interference and speculations about their feelings and circumstances should be avoided. Harming unjustifiably the dignity of individuals through words or pictures, even beyond their death, disobey the journalistic ethics.

The cases of suicide will be disclosed only when they have personal relevance or a real public interest, bearing in mind always the risk of a mimetic effect.

10. Safeguard the presumption of innocence

Any person accused of or charged for a crime has the right to the presumption of innocence in the information and opinions related to the investigations, lawsuits or criminal proceedings. The respect and protection of this right is valid from the beginning of the police interventions until guilt has been proved in a process celebrated with the necessary guarantees. The journalists should prevent prejudices and should not submit suspects to parallel trials.

11. Protect the rights of minors

Spreading the identity of minors should be avoided when they appear as victims (except in the case of murder and cases of kidnappings or disappearances), witnesses or suspects. This consideration is particularly relevant in matters of special social significance, such as sex abuse, suicides, problems related to adoptions or children of incarcerated parents. Besides, the journalists should avoid identifying against their will innocent relatives or other close people of accused or convicted persons in criminal proceedings.

As a general rule, children should not be interviewed nor photographed or filmed without the explicit consent of their parents, legal guardians, teachers or educators. It is also not fair to allege the public relevance of relatives or close people to justify the interference in the children's private life or the exploitation of their image.

12. Respect the dignity of the persons, as well as their physical and moral integrity

No one can be discriminated because of gender, sexual orientation, physical or mental disability, belief, ethnic origin, nationality and social extraction. Likewise, the journalists should avoid using degrading expressions that may incite hatred and the use of violence. The journalists need to be especially sensitive to diversity and act with a sense of justice and respect for the people and the groups affected.
APPENDICES
<h4>Appendix A: Advice on image manipulation</h4>
In photojournalism the pictures must be credited with author, date, place and relevant elements that identify the image, unless this could put in danger the safety of the sources. Manipulations that involve altering the visual information captured originally by the camera's lens and recorded on the storage medium are not allowed; that is to say: add, delete, move or modify any element of the original image.

In the field of photo-illustration the alteration of images is legitimate, without any other limit than the responsibility of the author, and with the obligation to inform, aptly, the reader of the type of alteration practiced.
<h4>Appendix B: Advice about Internet</h4>
The principles of journalistic ethics are common for all media and formats without any distinction. However, the characteristics of the Internet have led to an extensive casuistry that raises new ethical considerations for the professional practice.

1. Publisher's responsibility

The ethical regulations must rule especially the web pages that are the electronic version of existing publications in other formats, or those who, born on the web, have a header and a content that could be perceived as informative publications.
<ul>
 	<li>These rules should also concern people who publish on-line information as individuals and can be considered journalism professionals as they receive most part of their income from this activity.</li>
 	<li>This appendix of good practices of information on the Internet affects also journalists who have personal blogs or participate in a professional way in social networks.</li>
</ul>
2. Transparency and accuracy
<ul>
 	<li>The informative product must be recognisable as such, regardless of its formal nature. The distinction between information and opinion is also required, as well as the differentiation between advertising and information.</li>
 	<li>The information must be credited and the links should contain the correct references, with the purpose of guiding the recipients and keeping the data contextualized.</li>
 	<li>As in other media, the immediacy is no excuse to omit deontological principles as resorting to reliable sources and verifying the information.</li>
 	<li>The information that is been spread through social networks should not contain hearsay nor value judgements that could be offensive.</li>
</ul>
3. Active participation and supervision

Active audience participation enriches the plurality of media content on the Internet and is one of the most innovative defining keys of the new informative universe. However, the characteristics of the network generate new ethical traps on the relationship between the media and the public.
<ul>
 	<li>Feedback from users to the news disclosed on informative websites should be moderated by responsible publishers. These should count with mechanisms and appropriate tools to prevent the dissemination of offensive messages which could violate the dignity of the people and social groups or stimulate discrimination, violence and hatred.</li>
 	<li>The contributions on the Internet should not be anonymous. The diffuser should require a prior registration for users who wish to comment and give their opinions, in the same way that newspapers don't publish letters to the editor written by people who have not been properly identified. Anonymity is admissible when it tries to ensure information on facts and opinions of unequivocal public interest or vital need, but the participant must be equally identified in front of the medium.</li>
</ul>
4. Continuance of documents on-line

The indefinite continuance on the web of documents and audiovisual materials could produce undesirable or uncomfortable situations for the people affected, either if they are information sources or witnesses. In the case that they ask for erasure of the data, the requirement should reconcile the public interest with the individual rights. In any case, the invocation of the right to oblivion should not be reason for the immediate destruction of items that in some ways are part of a general archive or living memory which is a collective heritage and eventually may be of interest to historians and social researchers.
<ul>
 	<li>As a general rule, the claim for destruction of online-traces on behalf of individuals or legal entities should not be accepted obligatory when they allege simple reasons as a change of opinion or image, or other strictly personal considerations.</li>
 	<li>However, the persistence of certain documents should not generate abusive or harmful situations at the expense of the fundamental rights of the person.</li>
 	<li>Consequently, the responsible publishers should prevent or palliate the possible damages caused to people who have given their testimony (image, voice or documentation), due to the singular fact of the continuity, the ease of access and the reproduction and manipulation of the materials present on the internet. This attitude must be especially prudent when the affected are children or young people in a situation of defencelessness or risk against the possible use of their presence on the Internet.</li>
 	<li>In any case, the very nature of the web as a global and permanent stock with all kind of contents of universal access makes it practically unfeasible to remove discretionarily, systematically, instantly and extensively materials considered improper or harmful to individuals, companies or institutions.</li>
</ul>
5. Authorship and plagiarism

The recognition of intellectual authorship and all kinds of derived rights must be respected on the Internet in the same way as on any other informative format. The ease of copy and paste provided by those digital products, becoming a daily written and mechanical practice, should never be a pretext for plagiarism and usurpation.
<h4>Appendix C: Advice on plagiarism</h4>
The criterion 1 of the Code urges to check all the information, while the criterion 5 recommends, as a general rule, to quote the sources. These performance standards are the basis of the credibility of journalists, and their meticulous compliance depends greatly on the confidence of the public. Plagiarism means the reproduction without any credits of a significant part of somebody else's work.Doing so may constitute a crime, but it can also severely undermine the credibility of a journalist or a news medium. There are various forms of plagiarism, all of them detestable, although with different degrees of severity:
<ul>
 	<li>the literal reproduction of an extract of a literary work, a journalistic work or any other document of which the authorship is identifiable and provable.</li>
 	<li>the reproduction of photographs or images of any kind that have authorship, even though if they are not subjected to copyright.</li>
 	<li>the reuse of extracts of interviews or recordings that were obtained by journalists from other media and that could have been copied from broadcasts of someone else. Although the reproduction is not literal, disseminating information without quoting the other medium that obtained and spread it first can also be judged as plagiarism. The citation is particularly required in the case of a scoop or highly relevant information that other media obtained from sources that were only available to them.</li>
</ul>
When the credits of the origin of the information are well expressed or when it has been obtained directly from the same source or multiple sources, it cannot be considered as plagiarism.
<h4>Appendix D: Advice on treatment of war and armed conflicts</h4>
<ol>
 	<li>Give voice to all actors and promote the understanding between the parties involved. Dialogue must be encouraged.</li>
 	<li>Do not dehumanize one of the parts; it is necessary to report about the victims as well as the attackers.</li>
 	<li>Avoid the language of the warring factions and their allies. Expose the machination of any of them.</li>
 	<li>Show the groups that work for peace at the basis, not just the leaders; especially, the efforts of the civil society, which cares physically, materially and emotionally for the victims.</li>
 	<li>Explore the conflicts in all their complexities and deal with the violence and its visible and invisible effects, but also deal with the causes that generated the conflicts.</li>
 	<li>Avoid sensationalism and prevent the uncontrolled emission of warlike, xenophobic, racist and sexist online-messages.</li>
 	<li>Report on a conflict even if there is no violence, because that can help to prevent it.</li>
 	<li>Do not abandon the coverage after the cease-of-fire and deal with the resolution, reconstruction and reconciliation.</li>
 	<li>Take advantage of the similarities between the conflicts, because the constructive experiences will benefit those who have not yet found a way to resolution.</li>
 	<li>Quote always the information sources, particularly when they represent confronted factions, and bear in mind that third sources enhance the view of the conflict. In case that the information is made under censorship or with restrictions, it must be made clear to the recipients.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Appendix E: Advice on the use of the term 'illegal' referred to people</h4>
The term illegal applied to immigrants is wrong and violates the criteria of the Code of Ethics of the journalistic profession, for the following reasons:
<ul>
 	<li>People can never be illegal because this would deny to a human being the category of subject of law.</li>
 	<li>The inappropriate application of this word implies contempt of the dignity and self-image of these people.</li>
 	<li>The use of this word to designate, exclusively and continuously, the collective of workers who migrate means a discriminatory treatment and promotes stereotypes that criminalize the image of these people in the collective consciousness.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Appendix F: Advice on citation of nationalities and ethnic groups</h4>
The use by audiovisual media of words and concepts related to the nationality or the origin to designate in headlines an individual or a group of individuals that have committed criminal acts is discriminatory. When the information treatment given by the media enters a discriminatory context with the purpose of drawing the attention of the reader, that causes a negative attitude of the citizens towards migration and immigrants.

The CIC recommends the media to act with special responsibility and exactitude in the case of information or opinions with contents that could provoke discrimination for reasons of gender, ethnicity, belief or social or cultural background; they should avoid in any case the generalizations and the labelling of people because of differential features, whether ethnic, religious, economic or social. Anyway, if the medium believes that the nationality of the protagonists is relevant information, and without encouraging discriminatory ideas at the receiver, the CIC recommends mentioning it always, wherever the actors of the reported facts come from."
Spain;Code of Ethics;—;"(Approved at the Ordinary Assembly held in Seville on 27 November 1993 and updated in the Ordinary Assembly held in Merida on April 22, 2017)
PREAMBLE
Within the framework of the civil liberties enshrined in the Constitution, constituting the necessary reference for a fully democratic society, the profession of journalism represents an important social commitment, to make the free and effective development of fundamental rights over the freedom of information and expression of ideas a reality for all citizens.

As their subject and instrument of freedom of expression, journalists recognize and guarantee that their profession is the avenue for expressing free public opinion within the pluralism of a democratic and social constitutional State.

However, journalists also consider that whilst their profession allows them the use and enjoyment of their constitutional rights to freedom of expression and the right to information, this is subject to limits that prevent the infringement of other fundamental rights. These rules for professional behaviour must also be put into practice in the exercise of journalism whatever technological medium is used.

For this reason, in taking on these commitments, and as a true guarantee offered to Spanish society, which it serves, the journalistic profession understands that it is incumbent upon it to maintain, collectively and individually, responsible behaviour as regards the ethics and rules of professional conduct relating to information. Journalists, members of the Federation of Press Associations of Spain, make a commitment to society to maintain their own specific ethics and rules of professional conduct in the exercise of their profession.

By virtue of which, the General Assembly of the Federation of Press Associations of Spain (*) promulgates the following ethical principles and rules of the journalistic profession:
I  GENERAL PRINCIPLES
1. The journalist shall always act in keeping with the principles of professionalism and ethics contained in this Code of Ethics, whose express acceptance shall be a necessary condition for inclusion in the Professional Register of Journalists and the Federation of Press Associations.

Those who, subsequent to their inclusion in the Register and the corresponding Association, act in a manner not compatible with these principles, shall fall under the circumstances contemplated in the corresponding legislation.

2. The journalist's first ethical commitment is respect for the truth.

3. In accordance with this obligation, the journalist shall at all times defend the principle of freedom to investigate and circulate information and the freedom of comment and criticism.

4. Without prejudice to protecting the right of citizens to be informed, the journalist shall respect the right of persons to their own privacy and image, bearing in mind that:

a) Defence of the public interest alone justifies intrusion or inquiry into a person's private life without his or her prior consent.

b) In general, expressions, images or testimonies which are humiliating or damaging to the personal status of individuals and their physical or moral integrity should be avoided.

c) In news coverage of matters involving aspects of pain or distress for the persons concerned, the journalist shall avoid gratuitous intrusion and unnecessary speculation about their feelings and circumstances.

d) Restrictions on the invasion of privacy shall be observed with particular care if people have been admitted to hospitals or similar institutions.

e) Special attention shall be paid to the coverage of matters affecting children and young people and the right to privacy of minors shall be respected.

5. The journalist must embrace the principle that every person is innocent until proven otherwise and avoid as far as possible any harmful consequences resulting from the fulfilment of his or her journalistic duties. Such criteria are particularly enforceable if the information deals with matters submitted to the Courts of Law.

a) The journalist shall avoid naming in his reports the relatives and friends of persons accused or convicted of a crime, unless such mention is necessary for the news to be complete or fair.

b) The naming of victims of an offense, as well as the publication of material that may contribute to their identification shall be avoided, acting with special diligence in the case of crimes against sexual freedom.

6. The criteria indicated in the above two principles shall be applied with extreme rigour when the coverage may affect minors. In particular, the journalist shall refrain from interviewing, photographing or recording minors with regard to matters relating to criminal activities or those which can be considered to fall within the field of privacy.

7. Journalists shall exercise their professional zeal in respect of the rights of the weakest and those discriminated against. Therefore, they shall exercise special sensitivity in cases of news or opinions of potentially discriminatory content or likely to incite violence or degrading human practices.

a) Journalists must therefore refrain from alluding, in a derogatory manner or with prejudice, to the race, colour, religion, social background or sex of a person or any physical or mental illness or disability suffered.

b) Journalists must also refrain from publishing such details, unless they are directly related to the information published.
II  STATUTE
1. In order to ensure the necessary independence and equity in the performance of their profession, journalists must claim, for themselves and for those who work under their orders:

a) The right to decent working conditions, both in terms of remuneration and the material and professional circumstances in which they must carry out their task.

b) The duty and right to oppose any obvious attempt at media monopoly or oligopoly, which may impede social and political pluralism.

c) The duty and right to participate in the journalistic enterprise, so that their freedom of information is guaranteed in a manner compatible with the rights of the media in which the news is expressed.

d) The right to invoke the conscience clause, if the media on which they rely claims a moral attitude that damages their professional dignity or substantively alters the editorial stance.

e) The right and obligation to be provided with up-to-date and complete professional training.

2. Journalists are entitled to be protected both within the framework of their own company and by associations or institutional organisations, against those who, by applying pressure of any kind, attempt to divert them from the sphere of action set out in this Code of Ethics.

3. Professional secrecy is a journalist's right, as well as a duty that guarantees the confidentiality of information sources. Consequently, journalists shall guarantee the right of their information sources to remain anonymous, if so requested. However, such a professional duty may be surrendered as an exception in the event that it is reliably stated that the source has knowingly misrepresented information or when disclosure of the source is the only means to avoid serious and immediate harm to persons.

4. It is the responsibility of journalists to monitor scrupulously fulfilment by the Public Authorities of their obligation of transparency of information. In particular, they shall always defend free access to information from, or generated by, these Authorities, in their Archives or Administrative Records.

5. Journalists shall respect and enforce the copyright and intellectual property rights deriving from all kinds of creative activity. They shall avoid all forms of plagiarism and shall pay particular attention to ensuring that the reproduction of content via technological means does not infringe the rights mentioned.
III  PERFORMANCE PRINCIPLES
1. The commitment to the search for truth shall always lead journalists to report only on facts of whose origin they are certain, without falsifying documents or omitting essential information, and not to publish false, misleading or distorted coverage. Accordingly:

a) They must substantiate the information they circulate, including the duty to compare sources and to give the person concerned the opportunity to offer his or her own version of the facts.

b) Having been alerted to the dissemination of false, misleading or distorted material, journalists shall be obliged to correct the error suffered as quickly as possible employing the same typographical and/or audiovisual format as that used to circulate it. They shall also send an apology via the medium they use where appropriate.

c) In addition, without the need for the persons concerned to go to court, the journalist shall provide natural or legal persons with the appropriate opportunity to counter inaccuracies in a manner similar to that indicated in the preceding paragraph.

2. In the performance of their professional duties, journalists shall use justifiable methods to obtain news, which excludes unlawful procedures.

3. Journalists shall recognize and respect the right of natural and legal persons not to provide information, or answer questions they are asked, without prejudice to their professional duty to address the rights of citizens to information.

4. With the same exceptions provided for professional secrecy, the journalist shall respect the off the record rule if it has been expressly invoked or it is concluded that such was the will of the informant.

5. Journalists shall always make a clear and unequivocal distinction between the facts they recount and what may be opinions, interpretations or conjecture, although in the exercise of their professional activity they are not obliged to be neutral.

6. In order not to mislead or confuse users, the journalist is obliged to make a formal and rigorous distinction between information and publicity.

Providing news coverage at the same time as publicity or institutional or private social communication activities is understood to be contrary to the ethics of the journalistic profession when they affect the rules and principles of journalistic ethics.

7. The journalist shall not accept, directly or indirectly, remuneration or gratuities from third parties, for promoting, advising, influencing or having published information or opinions of any kind.

8. Journalists shall never use the privileged information they have learned as a result of their professional practice for their own benefit. In particular, journalists who are routinely or occasionally informed about financial matters shall be subject to the following restrictions:

a) They may not use for their own monetary gain financial data that come to their knowledge prior to its general dissemination, nor may they communicate such data to third parties.

b) They may not write about shares or securities in which they themselves or their family members have a significant financial interest.

c) They may not in any way negotiate shares or securities which they intend to write about in the near future.

9. The principles and standards contained in this Code of Ethics shall also apply in cases where journalists make use of digital or other technological communication or information systems in any format.

(*) now *""Federation of Associations of Journalists of Spain""*"
Sweden;Code of ethics for press, radio and television in Sweden;2020;"The press, radio and television shall have the greatest possible degree of freedom, within the framework of the Freedom of the Press Act and the constitutional right of freedom of speech, in order to be able to serve as disseminators of news and as scrutinizers of public affairs. In this connection, however, it is important that the individual is protected from unwarranted suffering as a result of publicity.

Ethics does not consist primarily of the application of a formal set of rules but in the maintenance of a responsible attitude in the exercise of journalistic duties. The code of ethics for press, radio and television is intended to provide support for this attitude.
WHAT CAN THE MEDIA OMBUDSMAN REVIEW?
The Media Ombudsman can review printed newspapers and magazines, Swedish broadcast radio and television, as well as some online publications, i.e. online publications that are members of The Swedish Media Publishers' Association (TU-Medier i Sverige) or The Magazine Publishers Association (Sveriges Tidskrifter), alternatively having filed for membership of the Ethical Press System.
RULES ON PUBLICITY
Provide accurate news

 	The role played by the mass media in society and the trust of the public of these media call for accurate and objective news reporting.
 	Be critical of news sources. Check facts as carefully as possible in the light of the circumstances even if they have been published earlier. Allow the reader/listener/viewer the possibility of distinguishing between statements of fact and comments.
 	News bills, headlines and introductory sections must be supported by the text.
 	Check the authenticity of pictures. See to it that pictures and graphical illustrations are correct and are not used in a misleading way.

Treat rebuttals generously
<ol start=""5"">
 	Factual errors should be corrected when called for. Anyone wishing to rebut a statement shall, if this is legitimate, be given the opportunity to do so. Corrections and rebuttals shall be published promptly in appropriate form, in such a way that they will come to the attention of those who received the original information. It should be noted that a rebuttal does not always call for an editorial comment.
 	Publish without delay critical rulings issued by the Swedish Media Council in cases concerning your own newspaper.

Respect individual integrity
<ol start=""7"">
 	Consider carefully any publicity which could violate the privacy and integrity of individuals. Refrain from such publicity unless the public interest obviously demands public scrutiny.
 	Exercise great caution in publishing information about suicide and attempted suicide, particularly with regard to the feelings of relatives and in view of what has been said above concerning the privacy and integrity of individuals.
 	Always show the greatest possible consideration for victims of crime and accidents. Consider carefully whether to publish names and pictures out of respect for the victims and their relatives.
 	Do not emphasize ethnic origin, sex, nationality, occupation, political affiliation, religious persuasion or sexual disposition in the case of the persons concerned if this is not important in the specific context or is demeaning.

Exercise care in the use of pictures
<ol start=""11"">
 	Whenever appropriate, these rules also apply to pictures.
 	Montage, electronic retouch and captions should be handled in such a way as not to mislead or deceive the reader. Whenever a picture has been altered through montage or retouch this should be stated. This also applies to such material when it is filed in picture libraries.

Listen to each side
<ol start=""13"">
 	Offer persons, who are criticized in a factual report, the opportunity to reply instantly to the criticism. Aim at presenting the views of all parties involved. Bear in mind that the sole objective of filing complaints of various kinds with various bodies may be to cause harm to an individual.
 	Remember that, in the eyes of the law, a person suspected of an offence is always presumed innocent until proven guilty. The outcome of a legal case should be published if it has been previously reported on.

Be careful with naming
<ol start=""15"">
 	Show careful consideration to the harmful consequences that might ensue for persons if their names are published. Refrain from publishing names if it might cause harm unless it is obviously in the public interest.
 	In case a person's name is not published, also refrain from publishing a picture of that person or details on occupation, title, age, nationality, sex, etc, which could enable identification.
 	Bear in mind that the entire responsibility for publishing names and pictures rests with the publisher.
"
Switzerland;Declaration of duties and rights of journalists;2017;"Preface
The right to information, together with freedom of expression and criticism, is one of the fundamental liberties of every human being.The rights and duties of journalists de- volve from the public's right to have access to fact and opinion.

Journalists' responsibility to the public must come before any they bear towards a third party, notably employers and public authorities.

Journalists should, of their own accord, adopt the rules necessary to accomplish their mission to inform. Such is the object of the «Declaration of Duties» below.

In order to carry out their journalistic du- ties in an independent manner, and in ac- cordance with required quality standards, journalists must be able to count on general conditions adequate to the exercise of their profession. Such is the object of the «Declaration of Rights» that follows.

Journalists see their duty in following the basic principles of this declaration. While recognising the laws of their country, journalists only accept the judgment of their professional colleagues, the Press Council or legitimate organizations of professional ethics. They reject any interference by the state or other official bodies. Fair reporting requires at least a short, published summary of a Press Council decision in relation to one's own media.
Declaration of Duties of a Journalist
The journalist who gathers, selects, edits, interprets and comments on information is ruled by general principles of fairness in his or her honest treatment of sources (the people with whom he or she is talking) and the public. The journalist's duties are:

 	To seek out the truth, in the interests of the public's right to know, whatever the consequences to him- or herself.
 	To defend freedom of information, freedom of commentary and criticism, and the independence and dignity of the journalistic profession.
 	Not to publish information, documents, images or sound recordings of which the origin is unknown to the journalist. Not to suppress information or any essential elements of a story. Not to misrepresent any text, document, image or sound recording, nor people's expressed opinions. If information is unconfirmed to clearly say so. To indicate when photographic and/or sound material has been combined to make a montage.
 	Not to use dishonest methods to obtain information, recordings, images or documents. Not to manipulate them, or have them manipulated by a third party with a view to falsification. To prohibit plagiarism in not passing off the work or ideas of others as one's own.
 	To rectify any published information that is revealed to be factually incorrect.
 	To respect professional secrecy and not reveal the source of any information obtained in confidence.
 	To respect peoples' privacy in so far as the public interest does not demand otherwise. To disregard anonymous or unfounded accusations.
 	In respecting human dignity, the journalist must avoid any allusion by text, image or sound to a person's ethnic or national origin, religion, gender, sexual orientation as well as to any illness or physical or mental handicap that could be discriminatory in character. The reporting of war, acts of terrorism, accidents and catastrophes by means of text, image and sound should respect the victims' suffering and the feelings of their loved ones.
 	Not to accept any advantage nor any promise that could limit his or her profes- sional independence or expression of opinion.
 	To avoid as journalists any form of commercial advertising; and never to accept conditions laid down by advertisers directly or indirectly.
 	To take journalistic directives only from designated editorial superiors; and to respect those directives only when they are not contrary to this declaration.

Declaration of Rights of a Journalist
Full respect by journalists of the duties articulated above requires that they enjoy, at the minimum, the following rights:

 	Free access to all sources of information and the right to investigate without impediment anything that is in the public interest. Public or private confidentiality can only be invoked against the journalist in exceptional circumstances and with the provision of clearly-defined reasons.
 	The right not to act in any way nor express any opinion that is contrary to professional rules or personal conscience. As a result, journalists should not suffer any prejudice.
 	The right to refuse any directive or interference that is contrary to the general policy of the organisation with which he or she is collaborating. This policy must be communicated in writing before the journalist's employment. It cannot be modified or revoked unilaterally under pain of breach of contract.
 	The right to transparency as to the ownership of the company for which the journalist works. The right of a member of an editorial team to be informed in time, and to be heard before, any decision that affects the future of the company. In particular, members of the editorial staff must be informed and heard before final decisions determining the com- position or organisation of the editorial department.
 	The right to adequate and continuous professional training.
 	The right to benefit from work conditions guaranteed by a collective agreement, including the right to be active in professional organisations without suffering discrimination.
 	The right to benefit from an individual employment contract guaranteeing material and moral security. In particular, an appropriate remuneration  corresponding to the journalist's function, responsibilities and social role  should ensure his or her economic independence.

United Kingdom (IPSO);Editors' code of practice;2021;"About the Editors' Code

 	The Editors' Code of Practice sets out the rules that newspapers and magazines regulated by IPSO have agreed to follow.
 	The Code is written and administered by the Editors' Code Committee and enforced by IPSO.
 	The latest version of the Editors' Code of Practice came into effect on 1 January 2021. Download the previous version here.

The Code
The Code  including this preamble and the public interest exceptions below  sets the framework for the highest professional standards that members of the press subscribing to the Independent Press Standards Organisation have undertaken to maintain. It is the cornerstone of the system of voluntary self-regulation to which they have made a binding contractual commitment. It balances both the rights of the individual and the public's right to know.

To achieve that balance, it is essential that an agreed Code be honoured not only to the letter, but in the full spirit. It should be interpreted neither so narrowly as to compromise its commitment to respect the rights of the individual, nor so broadly that it infringes the fundamental right to freedom of expression  such as to inform, to be partisan, to challenge, shock, be satirical and to entertain  or prevents publication in the public interest.

It is the responsibility of editors and publishers to apply the Code to editorial material in both printed and online versions of their publications. They should take care to ensure it is observed rigorously by all editorial staff and external contributors, including non-journalists.

Editors must maintain in-house procedures to resolve complaints swiftly and, where required to do so, co- operate with IPSO. A publication subject to an adverse adjudication must publish it in full and with due prominence, as required by IPSO.
1. Accuracy
i) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text.

ii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or distortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and - where appropriate - an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence should be as required by the regulator.

iii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies should be given, when reasonably called for.

iv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must distinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.

v) A publication must report fairly and accurately the outcome of an action for defamation to which it has been a party, unless an agreed settlement states otherwise, or an agreed statement is published.
2. Privacy
i) Everyone is entitled to respect for private and family life, home, physical and mental health, and correspondence, including digital communications.

ii) Editors will be expected to justify intrusions into any individual's private life without consent. In considering an individual's reasonable expectation of privacy, account will be taken of the complainant's own public disclosures of information and the extent to which the material complained about is already in the public domain or will become so.

iii) It is unacceptable to photograph individuals, without their consent, in public or private places where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy.
3. Harassment
i) Journalists must not engage in intimidation, harassment or persistent pursuit.

ii) They must not persist in questioning, telephoning, pursuing or photographing individuals once asked to desist; nor remain on property when asked to leave and must not follow them. If requested, they must identify themselves and whom they represent.

iii) Editors must ensure these principles are observed by those working for them and take care not to use non-compliant material from other sources.
4. Intrusion into grief or shock
In cases involving personal grief or shock, enquiries and approaches must be made with sympathy and discretion and publication handled sensitively. These provisions should not restrict the right to report legal proceedings.
5. Reporting Suicide
When reporting suicide, to prevent simulative acts care should be taken to avoid excessive detail of the method used, while taking into account the media's right to report legal proceedings.
6. Children
i) All pupils should be free to complete their time at school without unnecessary intrusion.

ii) They must not be approached or photographed at school without permission of the school authorities.

iii) Children under 16 must not be interviewed or photographed on issues involving their own or another child's welfare unless a custodial parent or similarly responsible adult consents.

iv) Children under 16 must not be paid for material involving their welfare, nor parents or guardians for material about their children or wards, unless it is clearly in the child's interest.

v) Editors must not use the fame, notoriety or position of a parent or guardian as sole justification for publishing details of a child's private life.
7. Children in sex cases
The press must not, even if legally free to do so, identify children under 16 who are victims or witnesses in cases involving sex offences. In any press report of a case involving a sexual offence against a child -

i) The child must not be identified.

ii) The adult may be identified.

iii) The word ""incest"" must not be used where a child victim might be identified.

iv) Care must be taken that nothing in the report implies the relationship between the accused and the child.
8. Hospitals
i) Journalists must identify themselves and obtain permission from a responsible executive before entering non-public areas of hospitals or similar institutions to pursue enquiries.

ii) The restrictions on intruding into privacy are particularly relevant to enquiries about individuals in hospitals or similar institutions.
9. Reporting of Crime
i) Relatives or friends of persons convicted or accused of crime should not generally be identified without their consent, unless they are genuinely relevant to the story.

ii) Particular regard should be paid to the potentially vulnerable position of children under the age of 18 who witness, or are victims of, crime. This should not restrict the right to report legal proceedings.

iii) Editors should generally avoid naming children under the age of 18 after arrest for a criminal offence but before they appear in a youth court unless they can show that the individual's name is already in the public domain, or that the individual (or, if they are under 16, a custodial parent or similarly responsible adult) has given their consent. This does not restrict the right to name juveniles who appear in a crown court, or whose anonymity is lifted.
10. Clandestine devices and subterfuge
i) The press must not seek to obtain or publish material acquired by using hidden cameras or clandestine listening devices; or by intercepting private or mobile telephone calls, messages or emails; or by the unauthorised removal of documents or photographs; or by accessing digitally-held information without consent.

ii) Engaging in misrepresentation or subterfuge, including by agents or intermediaries, can generally be justified only in the public interest and then only when the material cannot be obtained by other means.
11. Victims of sexual assault
The press must not identify or publish material likely to lead to the identification of a victim of sexual assault unless there is adequate justification and they are legally free to do so. Journalists are entitled to make enquiries but must take care and exercise discretion to avoid the unjustified disclosure of the identity of a victim of sexual assault.
12. Discrimination
i) The press must avoid prejudicial or pejorative reference to an individual's, race, colour, religion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation or to any physical or mental illness or disability.

ii) Details of an individual's race, colour, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, physical or mental illness or disability must be avoided unless genuinely relevant to the story.
13. Financial journalism
i) Even where the law does not prohibit it, journalists must not use for their own profit financial information they receive in advance of its general publication, nor should they pass such information to others.

ii) They must not write about shares or securities in whose performance they know that they or their close families have a significant financial interest without disclosing the interest to the editor or financial editor.

iii) They must not buy or sell, either directly or through nominees or agents, shares or securities about which they have written recently or about which they intend to write in the near future.
14. Confidential sources
Journalists have a moral obligation to protect confidential sources of information.
15. Witness payments in criminal trials
i) No payment or offer of payment to a witness  or any person who may reasonably be expected to be called as a witness  should be made in any case once proceedings are active as defined by the Contempt of Court Act 1981. This prohibition lasts until the suspect has been freed unconditionally by police without charge or bail or the proceedings are otherwise discontinued; or has entered a guilty plea to the court; or, in the event of a not guilty plea, the court has announced its verdict.

ii) Where proceedings are not yet active but are likely and foreseeable, editors must not make or offer payment to any person who may reasonably be expected to be called as a witness, unless the information concerned ought demonstrably to be published in the public interest and there is an over-riding need to make or promise payment for this to be done; and all reasonable steps have been taken to ensure no financial dealings influence the evidence those witnesses give. In no circumstances should such payment be conditional on the outcome of a trial.

iii) Any payment or offer of payment made to a person later cited to give evidence in proceedings must be disclosed to the prosecution and defence. The witness must be advised of this requirement.
16. Payment to criminals
i) Payment or offers of payment for stories, pictures or information, which seek to exploit a particular crime or to glorify or glamorise crime in general, must not be made directly or via agents to convicted or confessed criminals or to their associates  who may include family, friends and colleagues.

ii) Editors invoking the public interest to justify payment or offers would need to demonstrate that there was good reason to believe the public interest would be served. If, despite payment, no public interest emerged, then the material should not be published.
The Public Interest
There may be exceptions to the clauses marked * where they can be demonstrated to be in the public interest.
<ol>
 	The public interest includes, but is not confined to:
</ol>

 	Detecting or exposing crime, or the threat of crime, or serious impropriety.
 	Protecting public health or safety.
 	Protecting the public from being misled by an action or statement of an individual or organisation.
 	Disclosing a person or organisation's failure or likely failure to comply with any obligation to which they are subject.
 	Disclosing a miscarriage of justice.
 	Raising or contributing to a matter of public debate, including serious cases of impropriety, unethical conduct or incompetence concerning the public.
 	Disclosing concealment, or likely concealment, of any of the above.

<ol start=""2"">
 	There is a public interest in freedom of expression itself.
 	The regulator will consider the extent to which material is already in the public domain or will become so.
 	Editors invoking the public interest will need to demonstrate that they reasonably believed publication

 	or journalistic activity taken with a view to publication
 	would both serve, and be proportionate to, the public interest and explain how they reached that decision at the time.


 	An exceptional public interest would need to be demonstrated to over-ride the normally paramount interests of children under 16.
